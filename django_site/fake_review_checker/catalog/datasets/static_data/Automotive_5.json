For the price of a set of cheap Booster/Jumper Cables in a brick and morter store, you can buy extra long and heavy duty jumpers!  First off, don't be the person that not only needs to ask a kind passer-by for a \"jump\" but also if they have jumper cables.  It's MUCH easier to get a jump start if you have your own cables.Next lets talk about sizing.  Having the longest cable possible is a major plus if your car is parked up against something like a pole or wall, or even parked on a one way street.  The \"booster car\" (the car w/o a dead battery) can pull in close enough to use the cables without having to manuver into some akward position.  Or better yet, you won't have to push your vehicle into a position to be jumped.  If your diving a normal sized car they can even pull in behind you to jump you!  Or if their vehicle is the shorter of the two, they could pull in front.  Now how about gauge?  For those who aren't electricians or engineers, as the number value of gauge decreases, the size and capacity of the cable increases.  So for example 6-ga has about twice as much copper wire as 8-ga, and 4-ga is a about twice as much as 6-ga, so on and so on.  That doesn't mean you double the capacity of wire with every two numbers though.  4-gauge may sound like a lot but it really isn't.The technical stuff.  Don't worry if this doesn't make sense, you don't really need to know all of this, but I'm trying to make a point as to why to get the longest and heavist cables you can.  I'm not an electrican but I've worked with it long enough to know a few general rules of thumb.  First of the enemy of electricty is resistance.  Resistance ultimately determines the load a particular wire can carry.  Five things factor into resistance.  Temperature, conductor, voltage, load, and distance.  Temp we can't control, so we have to assume the worst (HOT)...or in other words need heavier cable.  Conductor should be copper, or at least a high purity mix of copper...good there.  Voltage...12VDC is a low voltage system...probably the biggest problem we face.  Since is a low voltage system we have to contend with voltage drop as it travels over the wire.  The higher the voltage, the longer it can run with acceptable levels of voltage drop over a particular gauge wire...so again since it's low voltage need heavier gauge wire.  Load (Amperage)...it's a car starter so it takes A LOT of power.  The voltage is a fixed number (more or less) so Amperage is determined by the size of the engine your trying to start.  And you'd be surprised how high that can be.  Even a small engine can be well over 300 Cranking Amps.  That said even a \"dead\" battery will put out some power.  As for distance...this cables selling point is also a draw back.  25' is LONG run for 12VDC.  So like I said in the last line 4-ga isn't as much as you think.  In fact, if you have an engine over 6-liters you should really consider 2-ga for this distance.  So summing up in layman's terms...considering the hot temperatures outside, the fact that it's 12VDC and we need a long cable, and that we're trying to start a car engine (which takes a LOT of power) these are the ONLY cables I could reccomend for anyone driving a small car up to a light truck.Lets talk about how to properly start a car with a drained battery.  Make sure the LAST connection make is the NEG clamp to the \"dead\" car on a frame ground (something metal and NOT MOVING or GOING TO MOVE in the engine compartment.)  Don't attach it directly to the battery's NEG post.  Next lightly rev the engine of the running vehicle for 3 to 5 minutes.  This will put a bit of a surface charge on the dead battery.  Then attempt to start the car.  As soon as it starts remove the cables (starting with the NEG on the car being jumped.)  If you ever have a dead battery for any reason...take it to an auto parts store as soon as possible and have it tested to make sure it still holds a proper charge.  Most places do it for free.  NEVER touch the clamps together once connected to a battery!!!  Doing so could damage you vehicles electrical system, and/or cause fire, burns, explosion of the battery, damages to your cables...A couple of final thoughts.  Protect your investment.  I bought a cable bag that works really well to keep them from getting tangled with everything in my trunk.  Also keep the twist ties that come with them which will keep them organized inside the cable bag.  And once used, take them home and clean and dry them before storing them once again.  The oils inside of engine compartments can be corrosive to rubber jackets and copper contacts.  These cables are more than worth they weight in gold!

THESE are jumper cables.  Let me explain.When you're in a bind on some dark night in some parking lot somewhere and your battery is dead, you need to get out of there pronto.In times like that, it's much easier to get a jump if YOU own a set of jumper cables.  It's double good if those jumper cables are long so that they can easily reach the battery of a good samaritan.  Now, according to electrical theory in order for DC current to flow across long distances, you need thicker cable.That's where these cables come in, they're long at 25' and thick at 2gauge.That's what these cables provide, maximum length at near maximum gauge cable.  And yes, your jumper cables SHOULD cost close to as much as your spare tire because that's what you need --- just look up the cost of copper on the market (that stuff is expensive).Yes, you can buy a $17 set of 10 foot, 18 gauge cables out there but if they can't reach between cars or if they can't carry enough power to start your car, you might as well have been lugging a brick in your trunk all those years and you might as well have enjoyed a good lunch with the $17 for all the false confidence it gave you.  I'm serious, buy an extension cord for $5 and you get as much jumping potential as many of the so called 'jumper' cables on the market --- there should be laws against marketing products that cannot jump start a car.  Worse, having no cables or less-than-worthless cables means that a criminal might reach you before you can get a jump and make your getaway.At the end of the day, you want a 25' or 20' cable, so you better be looking at 2gauge or 4 gauge cable - no compromises there.  You can go to 6gauge if you're working your way down to 16' cables.  But, the reality is that you always need a few extra feet when trying to jump start someone's car parked in some tight parking space --- so you're back to the 25' and 2 gauge.Pros- I know I can jump start a Semi with these (more importantly, I can get a jump from a Semi - Truck drivers are the good guys btw)- Extra long at 25'- Parrot clamp are strong, but an average guy can open them with one hand- Copper inserts in the parrot clamps is nice- Clamps are rated at 500amps- they're friggin heavy at near 14lbs, yes that's a pro!  that means there's 14 POUNDS of Copper in there and that's what allows the current to flow as freely as the Amazon river (no pun intended). It's huge.Cons- I do have an issue that the copper cable is not attached to the copper inserts in the clamps, it screws into the metal clamp rather than into the copper insert.  I don't know if that's a mistake or not.  I'm thinking about doing a bit of retrofitting.  I'm sure it's more than enough the way it is.Overall, these are as close an approximation to the kind of jumper cables that my dad had when I was growing up.  He custom made his -- he's old school.Anyway, if you're going to carry jumper cables, and you should --- don't muck around -- spend the dough, get these --- they'll last a lifetime and will not let you down.Advice, after you get a jump don't waste time rolling these things up in some dark parking lot -- just toss the heavy mangled mess into your trunk and get home.  There's always time the next day to roll these monsters back up and get them ready for the next wild adventure you might have.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Jumper Cables - The Real Deal", "unixReviewTime": 1287705600, "reviewTime": "10 22, 2010"}

For that you'll have to go to an electrical or welding supply company and you will PAY!  Probably between 3 and 5 times what these cost!  So unless you plan to start a towing service and need cables that will see daily use, I'd say these are gonna work for you.(Update: After compairing them to the 4ga cables I bought a month or so back for my car, they don't really seem that much thicker...  That's said they are MUCH heavier!  The individual stranding is of a thicker gauge than the other model so I'm guessing that's why the thickness isn't much more...)What I like:--Length - I bought these for a half-ton pickup.  Why?  Because it never fails that your battery will fail to start your engine when your parked in a packed lot with cars on all sides.  Rather than pushing a 3 ton vehicle out you pull the booster vehicle in as close as you can and let the length work for you.--Heft - these cables are no joke.  It's a workhorse grade cable that lets plenty of energy flow.  When trying to start a 5.7L V8, that's kinda important.--Solid Clamps - Unlike some of the other reviews, I don't have a problem opening my parrot clamps with one hand.  But their hardly weak, they'll clamp solid and stay put!(Update: If you really need 2ga booster cables and your skeptical of these, Deka makes a set of 2ga cables for around $150.  I have no personal experence with them but I have a little with the Deka name and they seem pretty good.)What I don't like:--Stiffness - They're not as flexible as I was hoping.  But about as flexible as I expected.  True welding cable in 2ga is about $3 per foot and per cable.  That's why the best jumper cables cost $200+.  Still I was hoping for a little thinner stranding to promote flexibilty.--Cable to Clamp - Like other reviews have mentioned the cable doesn't go all the way to a copper contact connected to the jaws.  Instead.  It's screwed to the body of the clamp then the copper jaws are also screwed to the body.  Still fine I'm sure.So why buy these cables aren't they overkill?  I've had this argument with people before: \"My 6ga cheapies start my truck fine.\"  Well I will attempt to addess this.  As the number in terms of gauge decreases the ammount of conductor increases.  In other words 2ga has more (perhaps 50-100% more) conductor than 4ga.  This doesn't automatically equate to twice as much power but it does certainly allow more power to flow safely.  For those that aren't aware (and I'm not an electrical engineer here), resistance is the enemy of all electrical circuts.  Resistance translates to heat in the same way that friction does when two physical surfaces rub together.  Five basic factors contribute to resistance in a give curcuit and determine the appropriate line size.  Ambient temperature, conductor, line distance, voltage, and amperage.  Ambient temp we have no control over.  Hot is bad so just assume the worst.  This means bigger cable to overcome the additon resistance heat is producing.  Conductor of these is copper so that's good.  You want pure or at least a high purity mix of copper in this type of conductor.  Distance and voltage.  One of these cable's strengths also happens to be a weakness.  Total run length for this circut is 50'.  Pretty long for a low voltage system like 12VDC.  The higher the voltage, the longer it can run on a given gauge wire without encountering too much voltage drop.  12VDC drops voltage on a circuit in a realatively short distance.  So heaiver gauge lines are needed to prevent this.  Amperage is also a big consideration.  The more amps a load pulls the more resistance the circut will generate.  Basically on a small wire, a large load will generate a lot of heat and one of two things will happen. 1) the wire will melt and/or catch on fire.  2) The load your trying to power won't work.  And make no mistake, starting even a small engine takes a LOT of energy!  So bringing it all together.  Large load, low voltage (that we don't want to make in lower), and a long distance run means that you wan the heaviest cables you can find.  Addressing the orignal question and statment.  6' 6ga cables might start your small-block fine.  But if you want or need the extra length, you need to consider heavy gauge cables.  That said I've personally seen light duty cables melt and smoke from starting an engine too big for them.Are these right for you?  So these will run you close to $100 shipped...do you actaully need them?  I own both these and the Coleman 4ga 25' booster cables.  Having no offical training and with no real sizing charts on the packaging I would say this.  The 4ga will do you fine at the 25' length for engines up to 5-liters or so (and honestly probably up to about 6L as well.)  Anything bigger than that and you should be considering these or something even better.Also protect your investment.  Buy a cable bag for them to keep them neat and protected.  Also keep the twist ties that came with them to keep them organized inside your bag.  I have the Arsenal #5888 cable organizer and it works great for this.

This duster keeps a relatively clean, maintained car looking show room shiny and takes only minutes to use. How many things out there can give you a spiffy shine in a couple of minutes?The key to using the Duster is to follow the clear instructions provided. You MUST let it dry out a day or two before initial use. It has a waxy coating on the fibers (all the more reason it DOES NOT scratch the finish) and it has to dry out before initial use. Have read a couple of reviews that claim the Duster scratches, but suspect it is because they didn't let it dry out. The one time I forgot to do that, it looked liked it scratched (scared the daylights out of me!), but it was just swirls on the surface from the moist wax - easily removed. And, if there is moisture on the car's surface, it too will look like a swirl or scratch until it dries.Second, it is is a DUSTER, NOT a scrub brush. Only to be used on finishes that are otherwise clean but have dust/pollen on them. If you scrub with it to remove mud, splotches, bird droppings, etc., it WILL scratch, just as dry rubbing a car's finish with ANYTHING will scratch it. You let the Duster do the work, lifting the dust right off the car. Doesn't just push it around, but actually lifts it off.Maker claims it only gets better with time and dirt, but of course can't figure out how that could be true. BUT, have never noticed any problem with use and dirt accumulation. Tried washing once, which maker says you can do, but seems to remove the waxy coating and defeats the effectiveness.

He is fanatical about keeping his car totally detailed. And this product works so well that he never even washes his car unless it gets rained on. He just dusts it every morning before he backs out of his garage, and if needed he uses some liquid instant detailer and a microfiber cloth after dusting if he feels like it. It takes a total of less than 2 minutes to dust off an entire car, yet the result makes your car look like you just washed it.I use the California Duster before putting on my car cover so that there is no dust between the car and car cover. If you have a garage, it's quite useful since dust settles on the car during the day when you are out and about and at night, even garaged. You won't have to wash your car as often if you use the California Duster. And dust won't build up if you use it often enough.Before discovering the California Duster, I found that after washing my car, I could only use my car cover for a few days before the car got too dusty to put a cover over. Now I find that I can keep the car dust free and use the car cover for much longer, which in turn means I don't have to wash the car nearly as often.I got the plastic handle California Duster which was significantly cheaper at the time I ordered. Although the wood handle one looks classier and probably feels nicer, the plastic handle one feels plenty sturdy, for the value oriented, get the plastic handle one since it's the exact same brush anyway!I am really very happy with what I paid for the Calfornia Duster and would not hesitate to recommend one to anyone with a car or motorcycle.

I have a dark grey/charcoal colored interior that is patterned and almost feels 'sticky' to the touch for lack of a water word.  Using a microfiber cloth didn't really clean up the dust too well and another duster I picked up here works ok on the radio console and steering wheel but not on the dash itself.Despite a few negative reviews here I decided to give it a go after a recent price drop.  Picked this up for $4.63 when I figured I didn't have much to lose.Put it out on the porch for two days on a stack of newspapers as was suggested.  After that I gave it a bunch of really good shakes and then ran my fingers thru the fibers a few times trying to get out any of the lose ones.  That seemed to do the trick because I haven't had any issues with stray red fibers all over the place or the pad falling apart as I've read in previous reviews.Shortly after I went out to the car and cleaned the outside and the inside.  Shook it out a bunch and it seemed to work great on the dash which has been a PITA since I bought the car.  Afterwards I brought it inside and used it to dust my entire first floor of my house.  This included behind my tv and entertainment center, on top of my refrigerator and all those other places normally buried in dust.  Worked like a charm, sucked it all up and didn't let go.So I'd have to say this, just like it big brother, the Original, works like a charm.

It cuts car drying time at least in half, maybe more, plus the effort to dry with this towel is less than with a standard towel or chamois.  If the car is in the sun or if you have hard water or if you are meticulous about your car, it may be a good thing to run a microfiber towel over the car after you use the Absorber to get the rest of the water off and to ensure no spots/streaks get  left behind.  When you are done, just wring most of the water out of the Absorber and roll it back into its plastic container for next time.  This is a great product for car drying or for cleaning up wet spills.

It's certainly super absorbant, but doesn't have the chamois quality I would need to, say, polish my bike frames.  That is to say it's more sticky than soft, more like a piece of foam rubber or neoprene than a cloth.So if I just hosed down the bike while cleaning and wanted to get on with the next steps of polishing and relubing, this towel is a great way to dry the bike when it's neither hot nor dry enough of a day for the bike to dry out on it's own in a fair amount of time.It really draws the water out too, from every knook and cranny, so no need to use DW-40 before lubing my nice clean parts.My wife uses ours for everything from picking up spills to quickly drying wet clothing that can't go in the dryer.  If you wash a sweater for example, it's best to roll it up in the Absorber before laying it out to dry, as this will cut your drying time to at least half and make it less of a hazard that the sweater will get out of shape.We use my far more grungy one as you might use a wet vac.  It actually does a better job than a wet vac though.Add that I've used several gum towels in Japan, mostly for swimming, and this is by far the thickest one I've used--therefore more absorbant.  And at 27\" x 17\" it's big enough to be used as a bath towel without having to ring it out over and over again.BOTTOM LINE:I recommend this particular make and model over others simply based on the large size and the thickness of the towel.Don't expect to use this to polish or dust, as the texture of the towel is far too sticky for that.I initially searched for the Sham-Wow on Amazon because I had seen it on TV, and still would like to try it out because it seems like it might be more chamois like--where you could wipe and polish with it.Overall, we're thrilled with the quality, size, and how well this item works.

It works well, and if you are very certain your freshly washed car is free from all debris, you will likely not cause any scratching. However, if you pick up some rogue sand granule or some other debris, you could cause clear coat damage.After watching an episode of Drive Clean and seeing them use microfiber towels in the same manner, I made the switch. It takes a little longer, but the microfiber towel is marginally safer on your precious paint job and if you're auto obsessed, it may be worth the extra time. The microfiber are also easier to clean, just wash and dry and you are on your way. This thing will get mold unless you let it dry out completely and is a pain to wash by hand.

This thing absorbs so much water you won't believe it till you use it, and it just takes a beating and keeps on going. When I first used it I was afraid I was gonna rip it by twisting the water out too hard, nope, just keep wringing it out until its dry and continue on.A little secret to using it, at least I've found it to work better this way. When drying the car, lay the Absorber out flat (unfold it across the surface) and then grasp it at one end at each corner and drag it slowly across the car allowing it to absorb all the water it comes into contact with. This works especially well on horizontal surfaces, but still good enough on the vertical ones as well. This practice also helps to prevent scratching of the surface when small particles get trapped between the chamois and the paint surface and then your hand comes and pushes it right into the paint.Little warning, when it comes, don't smell it. Mine reeeeekkkkkeeedddd! But I just rinsed it out and the smell went away. Yes it is true that you can put it right back into the tube wet (Well to get it back in the tube, you must, because you can't roll it once it dry), but I like to leave the top off of the tube to allow air in there to dry it out before I close it up and that musty gross smell comes back.Long story short: Get it, you won't be disappointed.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Absorber", "unixReviewTime": 1318032000, "reviewTime": "10 8, 2011"}

The Absorber is PVA, so it needs to stay a little wet because it gets very stiff when dry. Once you get used to it and how it works, it's great. There are a lot of PVA drying towels out there that are cheaper, but believe me, this one is superior in thickness and quality. I bought a cheap, generic one at Wal-Mart and it started tearing apart within a couple days.I use mine to wipe down just about anything and everything you'd use a normal towel for. It won't get something as immediately dry to the touch as a towel since it is slightly damp to start with, but evaporation quickly takes care of the rest. The main advantage over a towel is that it works like both a towel and a sponge, depending on how wet it is. It's nice and cool to the touch so it doubles as a cooling cloth in the summer heat. When it gets too wet, you just wring it out. When it gets a little dirty, soak it in a little soap and water and wring it out or throw it in the washer (just make sure you don't put it in the dryer, it comes out of the washer slightly damp, just like it should be stored).

I thought I had found the best shine wax protection using an rv wax called protect-all with UV inhibitors in it prior to trying this Flagship wax and used it for years and it did the job and nothing else on the market ( so I thought) was going to top it for fiberglass. I use McGuires Fiberglass restorer and that did the most amazing removal of oxidation on an older RV I restored back to new so I knew it had to be good and tried it.I ADDED REVISED REVIEW TO END OF ORIGINAL REVIEW ON THIS PAGE.........................................................................................................................Well after applying this Flagship wax to my already clean and shiny RV it took the shine to a whole higher level. 1st off it does go on easy, once on its stays kind of moist like but drys SOFT LIKE but it comes off nice, then I follow with 2nd dry cloth to make sure its completly off and shiny and it does come off easy and it does clean finish up leaving a nice shiny glazed surface. But you need to change up rags often because it cakes and smears if you dont.I read reviews on Amazon which enticed me to give it a try. One said dont let dry any longer then 3 min and bottle claims same ( This is very true I am so pleased at results.The biggest improvment was the nice gold painted bottom of the Motorhome where the paint looked good before but now the paint looks glazed, shiny, and rich like I never was able to get this high a shine before. It also does not cling to plastic, windows or rubber everything it touches it comes off of leaving a high shine on it, So I used it on everything.NOW THIS IS MY REVISED REVIEW AS OF AUGUST 2013. AFTER USING THIS AND LIKING IT AT 1ST... I FOUND IT WILL CONTINUE TO BEAD BUT WATER STREAKS SEEM TO STICK AND STAY ON WAXED SURFACE ON FIBERGLASS EVEN WASHING WONT REMOVE THEM EASY. SO I WENT BACK TO USING PROTECT-ALL ON MY RV. IT SHINES AS WELL BUT ALSO THE WATER STREAKS ARE MINIMAL AFTER A RAIN AND WASH OFF EASIER.I also find the protect-all brand wax to last long and come off cleaner after applying wax leaving a cleaner shine.Making it far easier to do a big RV in less time then Flagship wax. I FOUND fLAGSHIP TO BE CAKY THICK AND HARDER TO REMOVE AND HAVING TO CONSTANTLY GET FRESH RAGS TO MAKE IT EASY TO GET OFF.........So we tried it- liked it at first but then a week or so later found the flagship to not be as good as what I used for years in the Protect-all brand.

Then I used the standard hose and the nozzle would at best take the stream over the second story of the house with no problems.  While the stream was not a great as I would like it at least got there thusly making this nozzle super for getting at the upper windows.  Next, I placed the nozzle on the front of a hose end sprayer to test its ability to handle liquid weeder, fertilizer or detergent.  It did far better than the nozzle that comes with the hose end sprayer.  Old happy gardener.  When comparing the price of the unit to other available sprayers of similar quality I would have to go with some of the cheaper ones that are made of metal and not plastic.  Some, however, plastic sprayers are not all that bad and one heckuva lot cheaper than the almost $25 for this nozzle.  While it is not perfect, it does the job for what I specifically want to use it for.  Also, I used it on the truck to clean it and it did a decent job except in an effort to preserve water it is something of a pain to have to screw the nozzle each time you want to cut the water off.  In fact, it is doubtful that this nozzle will see vehicle washing again.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Nozzle if you have High Pressure", "unixReviewTime": 1244332800, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2009"}

You adjust the flow of water by turning the spray head at the front.  Water flow can be cut off at either end of the range, as the flow pattern goes from off, to a gentle sprinkle, to wide spray, and then narrowing into a beam, and then off again.  Because of the larger sized head, the \"ultimate\" nozzle has a larger area of coverage, and can deliver a larger volume of water.The nozzle does a decent job of diffusing water flow, producing a nice gentle flowing fountain of water suitable for watering potted plants or delicate flowers.  When adjusted more to a spray, it is well suited for vegetable gardens and general use.  This is however, nothing unique as far as sprinkler nozzles go.Fully open, the front aperture is about 0.12 inches in diameter, which produces a thicker stream of water than your typical cheapo nozzle.  Sometimes a thick stream is advantageous, but you will be using more water, and the increased water pressure may stress your plumbing.  Unless your system has high volume, and good water pressure, you may not be able to take full advantage this nozzle.The nozzle appears to be solidly built, and seems to work as advertised.  Unfortunately the aluminum parts on mine have a reddish finish, rather than green, which looks cooler.  Although it can deliver a higher volume of water, the assertion that it is the \"ultimate\" is perhaps an overstatement.  It does a good job, but not that much better than the various cheapo nozzles and spray guns.  The economy models typically don't last very long, so if \"the ultimate\" proves to be durable, it might be worth the premium cost.

Dynamat Xtreme is a butyl rubber compound covered by aluminum foil.  The butyl is viscoelastic - it has just the right consistency between solid and liquid to provide maximum sound damping.  The foil probably provides some level of fire resistance, since it is hard for a fire to develop without oxygen when it is sandwiched in between the metal layer.  Cheap alternatives that some people use include the asphalt based rolls of roof sealer.  However that stuff will smell bad when it heats up (whereas butyl doesn't have such odor) and it doesn't have an aluminum layer so it's more dangerous if it were to catch fire, and asphalt can ooze into a liquid.  The closest thing I have come across that resembles Dynamat Xtreme is Hard Cast Foil Grip 1402, a specialty tape sold to contractors for HVAC duct sealing.  This HVAC tape, a favorite of mine for all kind of sealing uses, is much thinner though.  It's also a butyl compound with a foil layer and is also very expensive.

There are some cheaper competitors that people swear are just as good and they may be, but I just don't trust them as much.  If you do your research you will even see that some people chose to use roofing material that you can buy at Home Depot.  Someone would have to be OUT OF THEIR MIND to put $20 worth of roofing tar into a $20,000+ vehicle.  The only negative thing people have to say about Dynamat is that it is priced high, but if you buy the bulk packs on Amazon you will save yourself a ton of money and is actually a pretty cost effective solution for DIY work.  I have looked around and Amazon has the best price anywhere.Main competitors and my impressions of them.  I have not purchased or used these product, but this is an idea of why I chose Dynamat over them.  I am not a car audio professional by any means.  This is the first time I used deadening on my car and I am writing this to help anyone else who is thinking of doing this.1) RAAMAudio RAAMmat + Ensolite Foam - Most cost effective &#34;legitimate&#34; option.2) Sound Deadener Showdown - &#34;CDL Tiles&#34; + Mass Loaded Vinyl.  SDS would be an interesting choice.  If you look through forums you will see some people who really like this stuff, but I found the website to be confusing and I could not truly make an informed decision one way or another.3)Fatmat:  Cheapest of all automotive dampeners, but one Google search of &#34;fatmat smell&#34; is all you need to know.  Some say it smells awful and some don't, but there is no chance I risk it.  This stuff is super cheap, does not deaden as well as competitors and stinks.  I would use home depot roofing material before this product.  Move on.And to the &#34;REAL&#34; competitor.4) Second Skin Audio- Damplifier Pro + Closed Cell Foam (CCF)-  Although I decided on dynamat, based on reviews and forum comments, I think that Second Skin Audios product line may in fact be superior to Dynamat, but I decided against it for a few reasons.  Damplifier Pro is a good bit heavier than Dynamat extreme.  For most, this isnt going to make a huge difference, but I am lining a performance car with more emphasis on performance than sound.  I want an improved sound system, but if the increase in weight is only going to improve things very minimally it is just not worth it to me.  A lot of people say that Dynamat is the most expensive, but a 36 sq. foot pack of Damplifier pro costs $204+ shipping.  They do have some coupons occasionally, but it is more expensive.The fact is Dynamat is proven to work and is trusted by professionals.  I do not think you can go wrong with Dynamat because the only bad thing people have to say about it is that the price is high which is a bit of a myth.  If you drive a big truck or SUV, want the absolute best sound and aren't as concerned with weight, I would think about the 80sq foot Damplifier Pro shop pack and CCF foam.I turned my trunk into a enclosure with Dynamat Xtreme.  I lined just about every surface, doubling up in a few critical areas and was able to line my trunk with this kit.  If you want to really go out and line an entire car, you will need 100 sq ft+ of this stuff.  If you are doing the trunk and doors like me, you'll need 50-80 sq feet depending on whether or not you plan to cover the entire door.  I would use the bulk kit for anything but the doors.  You can surely use the Dynamat in the bulk kit on the doors, but the door kit strips 12&#34; x 36&#34; and make for a cleaner install because they will run the full length of any door.  It would not be the end of the world to have extra, but I would try to make a good estimate of how much you will need so that you arent leftover with a whole box of this stuff.One final recommendation as I try to unload all of the information I have learned.  Dynamat claims that you do not need a heat gun to install Dynamat Extreme.  That may be true, but after using a heat gun to put the finishing touches on the trunk, I would have to strongly recommend using a heat gun for trouble areas and difficult corners.  I was able to put the Dynamat down so much flatter and nicer by heating it up a bit and rolling it down.  it especially helps to heat corners and tight spots where you cannot get the roller in, because it makes it easier to mash the Dynamat down with your fingers.  I am not going to use the heat gun on the doors however, as I believe that there are more heat sensitive components in there and do not want to chance it Dynamat claims it is not a necessity.I plan on using Dynaliner on top of the Dynamat in the doors (and trunk I think) as well as by itself in a few areas.  I really hope this helps someone.

With just the stock mirrors, any traffic directly behind the boat was absolutely invisible to me.  With the mirrors, that is no longer the case.I had two problems initially: one due to my own ineptness and the other due to being alone.  When I first got these out of the box and clipped them into the bottom of the door and the window groove, the horizontal bar was not horizontal at all.  Adjusting the straps straightened that out completely.  Also, the mirrors appeared to be fixed in position and any effort to move them seemed as if it might break them.  Well, there are three Phillips head screws that encircle the adjustment ball; loosen them and you can move the mirror any way you want.The major problem remains adjusting the passenger side mirror.  If I had somebody to move it for me, I could adjust it in just a minute while I sat in the driver's seat.  As it is, I had to get out, adjust the mirror, get back in, check the adjustment from the driver's seat and repeat ad nauseum until I finally got it right.  I don't fault the mirror for that.These mirrors come one to a box so you need to order two of them.

{"reviewerID": "A39AD95B47OEYX", "asin": "B00029WRJQ", "reviewerName": "Lg", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I highly recommend these mirrors. I did a lot of looking and comparing before I bought these. I have a 2006 Toyota Tacoma and these things fit well and do a real nice job. They vibrate a little but not excessive. The little bit of vibration I see doesn't interfere with my view. I also do not extend them very far. The further out you go with them the more they will vibrate. Just extend to the minimum needed in order to be able to see.Before attaching to the vehicle I think it's a good idea to loosen the three screws holding the swivel in place on the bottom of the mirrors and work in a drop of oil. Then do not over tighten these screws. They don't have to be very tight to hold the mirror still and not over tightening allows easy adjustment later. If you find they move when you close the door you can tighten a little more but to start off, finger tight with the screwdriver is all you need. I also placed a couple drops of oil on the aluminum sliding bar and worked it in before attaching. Also, when you bolt the mirror onto the aluminum slide bar, grip the base (the part with the internal threads) with a vise-grip or something (not too tight to crush it), then make sure the lock nut is between the bolt and the bar on the bottom, and then screw the bolt into the base (and through the aluminum slide bar) nice and tight without letting the base turn. You'll notice there are &#34;teeth&#34; on the bottom of the base. These are supposed to sink into the bar as you tighten the bolt. They keep the base from turning when you adjust the mirror. This is another good reason to not overtighten the three screws around the swivel. You want to be able to adjust the mirror from side to side and have it turn only at the swivel and without causing the base to turn against the aluminum slide bar.The bracket will bend the weather stripping on the outside of the window a little. It springs back when the mirror is removed but some of it will be permanent. It's not a big deal and you'll just have to deal with this if you want to use these mirrors. It is not a detriment to the operation of the window.I installed them as far forward as possible so that the top of the bracket was parallel to the ground and the new mirror sits right beside my existing one towards the outside. Tightening the ratchet by hand produced plenty of tension to hold it securely. Releasing the ratchet is another matter. It's too tight to just push it down with your finger. To release the tension I use a short piece of rope and loop it under the sliding buckle. Then I stand right next to the truck with the rope looped around one hand and my other hand on the ratchet release tab. I use my body leverage (knees and back) to pull upward on the rope a little which takes just enough pressure off the belt to allow me to press the ratchet release tab. You don't need to back the ratchet off very far - just enough to get the hook out from under the door. Then just close up the bracket and wrap up the belt around it and you're all pre-set for the next time.For better stability I advise when you're adjusting the belt, place the sliding buckle as necessary so that the crossbar forming the angle is not extended very far, if at all. And, yes, make sure there isn't any dirt behind the buckle or you'll get a scuff mark.You should have the windows all the way down when attaching to the vehicle. The bracket comes close to the window so you need to be careful not to let it scratch the window. After you get the mirror on I advise to raise the window very slowly to make sure that the metal bracket is not contacting (scratching) the window as you raise it. Once you're under way - be sure not to lower the window if there is any sand or debris laying on the bracket right next to the window or a scratch may occur from this action also. I've taken these off and on several times now and we've travelled with them and I've been relatively careful and have never had one scratch my window.On my truck, the doors fit really well and I can tell the difference when the hook for the mirror strap is hooked under the door. The door fits just a tad more tightly than usual. It has to be closed just a slight bit harder to make the latch engage and when I open the door it pops out ever so slightly because of the extra tension produced by the hook being in there on the bottom. I don't see this as a problem. The mirrors are not on there all the time and, even if they were, I think the latch mechanism on the Toyota is stout enough to handle it without any long term problems developing. Just be aware that the hook will slightly change thge way the door latches.The instructions are good, too. Not the usual loosely translated Mandarin.

The Lexol leather conditioner did a fine job in cleaning and softening the leather.The price on the conditioner in the last twelve month ranged from $11.24 to $7.99, so the price as I write this review is very good.

I find it very helpful.A quick note on the spray vs cream packaging. In the past I have used leather conditioning creams, so I bought the spray to compare how it would work. I have to say that overall I like the conditioning cream better because I have more control over where the product is applied.

Reinecke", "helpful": [8, 9], "reviewText": "I have just bought this product after using some of the cheaper ($6) leather conditioners for a while.  This one certainly seems to be the best at rejuvenating leather.  You can feel the waxy film on your fingers after applying it, which you don't notice with other conditioners, and shows it has somethign substantial in it.All my vehicles have had leather seats and after a few years they have all had dry, cracked creases.  I have just got a \"new\" used minivan with leather seats and I want to ensure they don't go the same way.  I have to admit I've neglected seats compared with the rest of the vehicle.I used this product on my 1998 pickup's tan-colored front seats which are creased and starting to crack in places.  They were pretty dirty and the only way I found to get the grime out was using a Magic Eraser and leather cleaning solution.  This is a pretty harsh technique, but effective, apart from in the deepest creases.  It did seem to take the shine off the leather, which was a worry.  Using the Lexol conditioner, letting it soak in for 15 mins and then buffing with a microfiber cloth, the sheen is back and the leather feels much more supple.  It will never return to its \"new\" state, but it should last a few more years with regular applications (not sure but maybe every 3-4 months?).  It takes some effort to get through the stickiness at the first buffing, but the surface quickly eases up and a nice sheen (not a false shine) appears.On my minivan, the leather came up like it was just new.  It smells good too!I bought this product at my local Advance Auto (sorry Amazon!) and would certainly suggest you pay the extra $3-4 over the other conditioners as it really seems to be properly designed to replace the oils in the leather, not just put a protectant shine on the surface.  I'm always sceptical about product claims (since they usually exaggerate performance), but this one seems to be the real deal.Try it.UPDATE (Dec 3 2009):The stiff leather has certainly become more supple after applying this product - it works really well!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Certainly does work the best", "unixReviewTime": 1255132800, "reviewTime": "10 10, 2009"}

It's a super long couch because it is actually two loveseats assembled together.  Each loveseat has an arm, one left and the other right.  Putting them together makes it one giant piece.  It's a lot of leather and that's why I bought this large container.I found that I had to buff a LOT more than I expected.  It took days for the conditioner to completely sink in after application, but I applied a heck of a lot thinking I was saving time.  You should be aware that buffing will probably be required and it will take some time for the leather to absorb the conditioner.The result is remarkable.  The color of the leather seems more vibrant and it has a shine actually.  Ultimately, this is protective of the leather and will make it last a lot longer.  In the meantime, it makes the leather look richer.One thing you will have a lot of trouble figuring out based on looking at product information for a large piece of leather furniture is what type of product should be used on it.  If you have an expensive piece, most likely there won't be instructions for this.  That's because the manufacturer doesn't want to take chances by informing you which conditioner you may use.  The retail representatives that I questioned didn't know anything about treating leather.Lexol works just fine on an expensive leather couch as my experience continues to show.

This is a car I detail by hand during the warmer seasons, so I decided to try Liquid Glass when it came time to revitalize the finish.The most appealing characteristics of Liquid Glass are ease of use, lack of residue, durability, and its ability to repel water and road dirt. This is possibly the easiest product to remove that I have ever used. You can apply it to the entire car in just about any conditions and buff it off very easily, although you may have some white powder floating around if you apply it too heavily. It doesn't stain plastic or rubber parts, so you don't have to worry much about where you apply it. Liquid Glass repels water so well that I can just about dry the car completely with the exhaust from my shop vacuum, with just a little help from a microfiber cloth. Its water-repelling properties make it useful to apply to all the glass on the car as well as the painted parts.Starting with essentially bare paint, I didn't find that a single coat of Liquid Glass was enough to produce the results I wanted, but two applications did the trick. I also tried a third coat to see what would happen, but additional benefits weren't apparent. (Each coat was applied on a different day to allow the product time to cure.) Liquid Glass produced a good shine, but the results didn't surpass what I've achieved with other quality products. Since I didn't have time to do any polishing, I wondered whether Liquid Glass would have some cosmetic effect of filling in swirl marks, but it didn't seem to do as much as some other products in this respect. There also wasn't an exceptional depth to the shine it produced on a black car. My impression is that the Liquid Glass finish is hard and durable, but on the thin side. It does, however, produce a slick finish that repels water and road dirt very well, so that sometimes I only need to rinse the car with water and blow it dry instead of washing it.Liquid Glass is a good product in many respects, and I intend to get my money's worth from the can I bought. The jury is still out as to whether I'll buy more or try something else.UPDATE: The product I ultimately decided to stick with is Turtle Wax Ice Liquid Polish. It's a synthetic polish with all the benefits of Liquid Glass that I described above. However, it's even easier to use than Liquid Glass, more economical, and produces a better-looking result. Unlike Liquid Glass, Turtle Wax Ice actually has some ability to mask swirl marks, and it produces a deeper shine.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good but not the Holy Grail", "unixReviewTime": 1334534400, "reviewTime": "04 16, 2012"}

What is nice about Liquid glass is that you do not need to reapply it every month to keep a great shine.Finally, I find that this is a very easy product to apply.  Follow the instructions and use the pre-cleaner the very first time you use this product and you will be good to go for a long time.  On certain colors (i.e. red) I sometimes get a bit of streaking.

It's a nice feeling not having to use wipers.It's hard to write another review for an outstanding product with numerous positive feedbacks under its belt. But unlike most people I used Liquid Glass with a different approach. I used my Liquid Glass in conjunction with Blue Magic's TR3 which in my opinion is slightly more abrasive, which makes it a better scratch remover & a better glazing compound than the Liquid Glass which is a better paint sealer and/or protector.My entire detail process took 2 days. Day 1 was washing & claying followed by a thorough polishing job with Blue Magic's TR3. After the required 2 hrs cure for the TR3, Liquid Glass is applied with an orbital buffer that has Mequiar's W8006 polishing pad attached to it.Follow instructions & let the Liquid Glass \"bake\" in the sun with ambient temp above 70 degrees for a minimum 4 hrs.  I applied a second coat on Day 2 once the ambient reaches above 70, again let it bake for 4 hrs before applying 3rd coat.The end result is complete paint restoration that looks like no other wax job unlike anything I have ever seen. My 97 Chevy Dually now looks like a new truck with a brand new layer of clear coat paint over its once dull, faded paint.For as long as you are willing to invest the time by applying multiple coats & baking it for 4 hrs in between, you will never look back at \"any\" wax, paint sealer or polish etc out there.

I have bought 2 brand new cars since 2009 and I have kept them looking new by buying all kinds of car caring products. I visit a lot of different car forums and collect the best car care products including cleaners, wax, tire shine etc. If you need advice on recommended tire shine, cleaners, car wash, write a comment. I have heard about liquid glass before but I wasn't convinced that it was as good as people say it is. I was tired of applying wax all the time and the results were great but it didn't last long. I bought my second car several months ago and I wanted to keep it looking new all the time without applying wax every week. I almost purchased OptiCoat 2.0 because many people say it is a permanent coat on top of your clear coat and it lasts well over 3 years. I decided not to buy it because I don't think my car will keep looking new for three years after applying a product one time. So I did some research on other products and I came across liquid glass again. This is a very old product that has been around for over 20 years but the formula has slightly changed over time. The ownership of the company has also changed but the product is better than ever.It's very simple to apply and keeps the car looking shiny and it is somewhat permanent. Since my car was new, I didn't use a clay bar to get all the materials off the paint. I simply used the liquid glass pre cleaner and then applied liquid glass polish. You have to make sure the paint is clean and defect free. If you have rock chips, I would recommend applying touch up paint first because the liquid glass will permanently seal those chips and will be hard to fill later. I applied one layer of liquid glass using a microfiber cloth one section at a time and let it dry for 15 minutes and then cleaned off the haze using another cloth. Make sure the temperature is at least 50 degrees and there is sunshine. After doing the entire car, let the car bake in the sun for about 4 hours and apply another coat and let that bake. After my second coat, my car looked better than new and I am not kidding. It is a white car and it had a deep shine to it. I can tell that there is a layer of protection on my car. It has been two months since I applied the two coats and to this day water just bounces off my car and dirt barely sticks to the paint. I also applied liquid glass to my mirrors and windows. It's funny to see the water sliding off my glass when it rains. It is very easy to wash my car now because the dirt does not stick to the car as strongly as it used to. Liquid glass can be applied many times as desired without removing the old coat; it is actually recommended that you apply multiple coats. The more coats you apply the deeper the shine gets. I have read in many places that after about 20 coats, the paint will have a lot more rock chip protection. The layer will get thick and will protect your original paint from chips. Obviously you can't expect total protection because rocks can fly at your car pretty fast.  I am waiting for better weather to apply more coats. I actually bought a gallon of liquid glass from autobarn.com for around $60. You should not apply any wax on top of liquid glass if you plan to apply more coats because you will have to remove that wax before applying another coat.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "After a lot of research and trying it out, I agree with all the other reviews", "unixReviewTime": 1392768000, "reviewTime": "02 19, 2014"}

The idle was very rough and noisy, and the engine wasn't as smooth as it should have been in general, especially at lower engine speeds.  The problem was so bad that the engine would almost stall at idle after first being started.I tried Lucas \"Upper Cyclinder Lubricant and Injector Cleaner\", and it didn't seem to help at all.  Then I put a full 20-oz bottle of Chevron Techron through the fuel tank, and it also seemed to do nothing.  In each case, the product was used as directed, and the car was driven until the fuel level was very low.  That is, I didn't refill the fuel tank and dilute the product in either case.  In the past, I've also used other brands of fuel system and fuel injector cleaners, including Gumout and STP.  None of these products seemed to have the slightest effect.Finally, and extremely skeptical, I tried Sea Foam Motor Treatment.  I put a full 16-oz bottle in the fuel tank after filling up.  The improvement was dramatic and immediate.  The engine ran much more smoothly and quietly than before.  The engine no longer idled like a diesel farm tractor.  I was extremely surprised, but still skeptical, because I wasn't sure if it had actually cleaned anything, or if it was simply helping because it was being burned with the fuel.  So, I withheld judgment until the fuel tank had been driven to near-empty and refilled, meaning that the amount of Sea Foam left in the fuel would be negligible.This was no placebo effect.  Even after refueling, the car ran much better than it did before.  It now idles more nicely than my Hyundai, which still seems bizarre to me.  I am extremely pleased, which doesn't happen often, trust me.  I'll be putting a can of Sea Foam Motor Treatment through my fuel tanks before every oil change from now on.My other car, a Hyundai Sonata, had an annoying ticking sound when it would idle, especially when cold.  I would have described the sound as a \"lifter tick\", but I'm not sure what it was--a sticking valve?  I don't know; I'm no mechanic.  I added the recommended amount of Sea Foam to the crankcase, and the sound went away immediately, or nearly so.  I've since changed the oil in that car, and the sound has not returned.Some people criticize Sea Foam based on its age.  I find these criticisms ridiculous--as if \"older\" equates with \"worse\".  Do these people ever address the actual chemistry of the product, or provide actual reasons for their disapproval?  No, they just complain about how long it's been around.Sea Foam made me a believer.

For about the past 6 months, I have noticed about a 2mpg drop in fuel economy.A couple of my friends have used this stuff and claimed success, so I gave it a shot.  I added a can to the fuel tank, and half a can each to the crankcase and air intake.  Let it sit and drove it around.  It smoked like crazy as promised.Now, anecdotally, I do think it smoothed out my idle and I haven't had a hard start.  But, there is nothing I can quantify, and I am not sure that the improvements are not all psychological.  I think my truck runs better if I wax it.  My use also coincided with the end of winter, so the operating temperatures can account for the improvements, too.  I did not see an improvement in mpg.So, if this is where my story ended, I'd say give it a go.  If it works, great.  If not, you didn't lose too much.BUT...The second tank after using this I got a o2 sensor code and had to replace a downstream sensor.  To be fair, the truck has 100k, and this could just be the natural lifespan of the sensor.  Since I had already noticed a drop in mpg, the sensor was likely on its way out.  At the same time, I think it is rather interesting that it failed less than 300 miles after using this product when I've been driving around with the diminished mpg for several thousand miles.  My personal belief is that the big blast of smoke just pushed a failing sensor over the edge.So, no, I won't use this stuff again.

The past 15 years, the car has always passed smog with flying colors (usually, all the numbers are 0 or close to it). This year, the car passed everything fine with the same record, except NOx at 15 mph. Reading online said that this is the place to fail if your car is going to fail. Prior years, the number was 50, with a max limit of 480 or so. This year, it went up to 780.So, I bought seafoam and, unlike a lot of other people, my car hardly smoked at all. I baby my car usually (short shift, cruise at 60-65, easy on the gas and brake and clutch) all in the name of gas mileage. With only an intake, exhaust, and headers, I average into the mid 40's for gas mileage average, when the EPA for the car is 25/33.I'm not sure if this is something to do with my car getting old and the Catylitic converter is getting bad, but after Seafoam, the car registered a barely pass of 460 out of 480 max.For those of you who wonder, I added the seafoam through the brake booster vacuum line. This, from what I have been told, is good for a quick fix and to pass smog. I later dumped the rest of the can (2/3 left) into the gas tank. Its hard to notice, but I believe the car idles a bit easier (no gushing kind of noises). Could be cleaning the injectors.Whatever the case, I passed smog and plan on using this the next time I go in for a smog 2 years from now.I read a lot of forums online and there is great debate over seafoam. It took me a while to buy it, but it worked. 5 Stars! Worst that happens is you put it into a car that is held together by carbon deposits and your car leaks. If you car leaks oil already, or you believe it has the possibility to with engine cleaning, don't buy this. But if you have high NOx or other figures, this is is a good buy to pass smog.

Edelman", "helpful": [11, 12], "reviewText": "I bought my can of Seafoam locally, on the advice of those on the Yahama  Vino 125 owner's group. The engine on my Vino 125 scooter had been hard starting, and running rough- signs of a gummed up fuel system. I was hoping I could clean it out without having to disassemble everything to get at the carb, a major pain on the Vino. I added 2 ounces of Motor Tune to a full tank, and let the scooter run for an hour. And surprise, the engine smoothed out. No more coughing and sputtering. Started a lot easier after it cooled down, too.  I added the rest of the can of Motor Tune to the tank of my 2003 Honda Element, which, my mechanic tells me, could use a fuel injector cleaning. Might just save me a hundred bucks here.So what's in it? The MSDS (manufacturer's safety data sheet) says it's 40-60% \"pale oil,\" 25-35% Naptha, and 10-20% IPA. Naptha is a light hydrocarbon fraction, lighter than gasoline. Lighter fluid and Coleman Fuel are naptha. Pale oil is a very light, heavily refined, pale yellow oil- several sources tell me that kerosene is pale oil. And IPA is just isopropyl alcohol. Amazingly simple- you could make up your own mix, which I might just do next time. (One experimenter who did a lot of testing suggests four parts diesel fuel, 2 parts naphtha, and 1 part \"HEET\"  brand IPA.) The IPA binds to any water in the tank or fuel line, I suspect the naptha dissolves varnish deposits, and the oil is a carrier, according to a mechanical engineer I spoke with.Incidentally, I found my can on sale at the local O'Reilly's for $4.99 for 16 ounces.

I put my first bottle (about half of it) in my ATV which was running a little rough. Threw some in the fuel tank and then sprayed some (with a spray bottle) directly into the carb while running. Let it sit for 5 minutes and repeated. It instantly ran smoother and had better throttle response. I thought okay, not bad for a quick &#34;miracle in a bottle&#34;. So i went over to my weed wacker which would run like crap at anything over half throttle. I figured if this stuff could fix my weed wacker than it has my approval.  I added a little to the fuel and repeated the same process (spraying in the carb and letting it sit twice). It smoked a ton but ran like it was straight out of the box new. SOLD!

Everything runs like it is brand new. Forget bringing your stuff to get fixed by a mechanic. For cheap money up front you can do a little preventative maintenance and stabilize, clean the gunk out of your machines, and keep them running smoothly.When I put it in my vehicles, I threw a third of the bottle in the fuel tank, SLOOOOWLY (READ SLOWLY) dripped a third of the bottle in my vacuum line, and may toss the last third in the oil right before my next oil change. If you throw it in the oil you need to change the oil and filter within 100 miles or it will be bad for the engine. Don't put it in the vacuum line quickly or you will hydrolock your motor and destroy your engine. You will be fine as long as you slowly drip it.

Once all used, TURN OFF CAR.  Let sit for at least 5 minutes(preferably 15) and then turn the car back on and DRIVE IT somewhere, aggressivelybut not irresponsibly.  Do so for 20 minutes or so or at least until the smoke dissipates.Most cars don't need this treatment but I can see it on an older car or a vehicle that'sbeen abused and requires a full tune-up.Be ever mindful that the deposits you liberate from the engine may, in fact, be all thatholds the motor together.  Oil might not lubricate as well (or at all) if the clearances betweenbearings are so wide (without the deposits in place) that it can't reach them.  Take care whenusing this product, and do so responsibly.Better idea: run 20% Marvel Mystery oil in your crankcase (use 1 of each 5 quarts as MMO), add 4 or 5ounces of it (per 10 gallons) to the fuel, and pour some down the carburetor (or into PCV valve or acarefully-selected vacuum line) ) once the car is started.  Don't go crazy with the amount you pour intothe engine directly.  Run it in a new oil change: use cheap (but new) oil.  Use a cheap (but decent)  oilfilter like a Fram ExtraGuard [the Orange Can].  Run for 2-4 weeks.  Change oil again with a good filter(Motorcraft are my favorites but Purolator and Mobil 1 are great as well) and decent oil (preferably synthetic)and watch the crap drain out with the oil/Marvel Mystery Oil combo.  Continue to run good oils and filtersfrom then on, and perhaps repeat this procedure every few years or as you believe it necessary.Seafoam is a far more aggressive crankcase cleaner (flush) solution which fewer cars are inbad enough condition to require.

I've used their leather cleaner, leather protectant, and 2-in-1 leather protectant with great success, so I had high expectations for the Vinylex.The best way to describe Vinylex is that it is almost like 303 Aerospace Protectant, which I have used for over 12 years with good success. Vinylex is a white milky liquid that is applied to plastic and rubber to protect it from UV radiation and degradation. It's not supposed to contain silicone which can dry out dash board materials.I've used the Vinylex on polycarbonate, plastic car trim, dashboards, steering wheels, center consoles, and the plastic body panels on my Ducati Monster 696. It dries cleanly leaving no greasy residue or smell. There are no streaks either. However, I don't recommend using it directly on the grip area of a steering wheel or any other surface where friction is required for safety purposes. It does get somewhat slippery even when dry.The directions indicate to shake well, so there's probably some ingredients that settle. However, I recommend covering the nozzle with a cloth when you shake it because some product does come out. I just use old (but clean) cotton socks for applying the Vinylex. The best part about Vinylex is that there seems to be no off-gassing after applying it on the dashboard. When I tried Armor All products and even 303, it tended to leave a filmy residue on the inside of the windshield as it dried out. The 303 also had an odd smell, whereas Vinylex is almost totally odor-free. I also used Vinylex on the EPDM rubber door seals on my cars.Overall: 5/5 stars, highly recommended.

He suggested to use this stuff and to NEVER use anything by Armor All because the greasy film produces a greenhouse effect, trapping all the rays the sun puts out and basically cooks the plastic, causing premature aging, cracking, etc.. I foolishly started using Armor All about 3 years ago because it made the plastic in my car look really nice and had a deep, rich black color it was starting to lack. But then I gave Vinylex a try and once I removed the Armor All that was previously applied, I noticed that my circular air vents actually turned a little white. I can only assume the AA caused that. So I stripped all my interior plastic of the AA and used Vinylex and, depending on how much you apply, leaves a really nice matte finish with a slight bit of sheen, but with no glare in the windshield. The AA wipes I used, even if I wrung them out, still left a highly reflective shine on the dash.The best way I found to apply Vinylex is to take a good quality microfiber towel, fold it and then spray about 3 good squirts, rub it in and that should cover a whole door panel with ease. Then switch to a clean side of that microfiber and kinda wipe off or buff some of the wetness you may get on the plastic. Also use it on interior weather stripping where the doors shut-- mine were looking spotty with water and almost chalky, simply because I never bothered to clean them. The Vinylex made them look dark black and brand new. I have access to this stuff because the Toyota dealer I work at sells it and a lot of it. I've honestly never seen it anywhere else. My first impression of Vinylex was, \"Eh, it's a cheap product, I can guarantee it\", simply because of it's outward appearance.

U am here to say otherwise.The first is someone stated they are having issues with this sealant causing swirls. No liquid, in any way, will ever put swirls in a car. The one product that wi is the applicator you are using to apply the product. Always make sure you have a good microfiber or foam applicator.Second, and the one people have the most difficulty with, is how hard it is to wipe this off. This is a wipe on wipe off product that applies very very thinly to your car. The proper application is to dampen your applicator with water, put some klasse in a small spray bottle and spritz it on the applicator. Then apply to a small section and immediately wipe off. The longer you wait, the harder it will be to remove.This stuff is meant to last and it does. Traditional waxes would have to be applied on the entire car and then you would wait and then wipe off. This is a sealant, it requires little time to cure or adhere to your paint.I use this and a 33oz bottle I figure will last me at least 5 years, applying one coat twice a year on a mid size sedan.Klasse is very slick. After a rainfall, the only thing that is wet afterwards is the trunk and center of the roof, as those are the only flat parts.It also gives off a great shine and lasts me 6 months with washing twice a week.If there are some spots you missed and the product has dried on or is too hard to remove, simply apply more and rub off.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "PLEASE READ: EASY REMOVAL", "unixReviewTime": 1358121600, "reviewTime": "01 14, 2013"}

Just a light one.  Then BUFF with a soft double folded cloth.  If you put it on LIGHTLY, it will only take light buffing.  If you mistakenly put it on heavy, you may have a tendency to RUB IT HARDER --- BUT THAT CAUSES SWIRL MARKS from even a soft towel thread.  So If you put it on heavy,let it dry.

I was slightly worried when I first ordered because I did my research and knew this was the case. I ordered anyways because of the lack of reviews on other types of horns out there. I put these on the front of my Hyundai Elantra and completely removed the stock horn.Keep in mind that the only thing that comes in the box is a pair of horns (high tone and low tone) and a relay. USE THE RELAY. You might think that the power going to the stock horn is sufficient but run a volt meter to it, when the horn is pressed, and chances are you are getting less than 12V. Just as you would think the extra power just creates a louder horn.I got all of my supplies from Home Depot. A 36x1\" bar of steel and 2 nuts and bolts. I cut this down and drilled two holes to mount my horns to because I didn't have room in the stock location.

I put it on in minutes after delivery and warming a little, and it is not moving; low 80's outside today but likely over 110F in the car. I do not have sweaty hands and it does not look like color came off. It is smooth leather and is dyed black, much like belts and shoes, which can rub off on contact (belts do after repeated hand-contact and probably stain the inside of belt loops without our knowing). For those with sweaty hands get a rubber-cover with grips (stinky) or vinyl (slippery) but neither are very durable in hot cars; you won't be as happy with the comfort unless it is leather. Non-leather will smell toxic or be slippery, but it will not bleed color. If your hands sweat they may slip on vinyl or smooth rubber. This product has a great grip and feel and leathery smell.There is an inner rubber-sleeve )non-smelly) that prevents the cover from moving. I set the product in the sun for about 5 minutes and it made it ply-able enough to work it on. I recommend starting with the center-most seam on top of a straight wheel(there are 3 seams at roughly 12,4,8 O'clock), carefully work the outer edge over the wheel and down both sides evenly (the first 3/4's is easy), use patience and care, then roll the edge into position. If it is off-center it cannot be slid sideways. Take it off carefully and begin again with it more centered and work each side evenly; a little here, a little there. Do not put this on cold or stretch without warming; it can damage/crack/tear cold leather.I placed this on a 15\" 2008 Chevy Aveo5 steering wheel (do measure your wheel diameter before ordering). The only con to these types of covers is they cannot wrap the inside, so the fingers feel the outer edges of the cover; in this case it is smooth, rolled, and well stitched and I have gotten used to it. It is probably made in China at this price but it looks and feels like good quality. I recommend this and would choose to buy again and recommend to a friend. I also recommend a little leather conditioner on this, much like one would use on leather car interiors. It is smooth leather, not suade or roughened.In 'the old days' I bought wrapped 'stinky' vinyl, and used vinyl to thread through holes and wrap around the cover with tension (still available) and it filled the inner part of the wheel. It was difficult and time-consuming, and, the vinyl strings eventually breaks. I recommend this 'new and improved' version. Rubber and vinyl degrades in heat and UV. Did you know that wonderful 'new car smell' is highly carcinogenic, expecially when hot, and all the glue they use on carpeting and interior fabric, also. This has been well known and accepted for over 50 years but it sells cars. FYI.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Really Excellent Quality", "unixReviewTime": 1377216000, "reviewTime": "08 23, 2013"}

R. \"Monkihead\"", "helpful": [16, 18], "reviewText": "Like others I have found the cover to fall short in the sizing department. I understand it's leather and unlike a comparable vinyl based product, sizing is critical because unlike vinyl, leather can't be stretched too much for a fit. This limits you to a steering wheel that is within 5mm of the product's diameter. I have tried fitting this on two steering wheels. First on my F250 and it was literally impossible. The diameter of the cover missed it by inches. Then I tried fitting this on my Saturn Vue. Now this is important, because the Vue is geared towards women whom have small hands, ergo the steering wheel is smaller and skinnier. So you would think the Vue is a perfect candidate...NOPE. I wrestled with the installation and would described it like sparring with a bear. After 10mins (not including breaks) I finally got the thing on the Vue. The result was the leather had stretched so much, it literally developed permanent stretch marks. Also, like other's who have commented in their Feedback, the wrap only made it barely halfway around the grip of the wheel. So there are now two pressure points on my hands from the front and back seams of the wrap when gripping the wheel.I gave it a rating of three due to it's exceptional quality. It is well made in the sense that its leather is very thick and the seams are well stitched. If this was right-size for my application it would have rated it Five.Part of the poor fit was my fault since I didn't pay close enough attention to the specs and prior to ordering I should have measured my steering wheels for proper fit. I mistakenly assumed since I had two steering wheels and one that is especially skinny, that It wouldn't have been a problem fitting.Take proper care with the dimensions of 15 x 1.5  Measure the girth of your steering wheel with a seamstress measuring tape. If 1.5\" does not cover at least 70% of you steering wheel circumference and the wheel's diameter is great than 15 inches, you will be immensely disappointed or at the very least frustrated with the install.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Well made, but beware of your vehicle's dimensions", "unixReviewTime": 1344902400, "reviewTime": "08 14, 2012"}

Here's what you do - wash your car well, using one of the better car wash solutions like Meguiar's hi-tech wash or P21S car shampoo.  Dry.  Then use Griot's Garage (or similar) paint cleaning clay to remove surface contaminants and start to work on the swirls and other imperfections in your paint.  (You can skip this step, but I've recently discovered this cleaning clay and it really does wonders, especially on cars that spend a lot of time in the woods where birds, bugs and tree sap are unavoidable).Now - get out the 3M Imperial hand glaze.  This stuff is very finely abrasive and supremely gentle on your paint - clear coat or not. Use a terry or foam applicator pad to rub the glaze into the paint and rub out fine swirls and scratches.  Work on a small section of the car at a time -- perhaps a square foot or so of surface. Always buff the glaze off, before it dries, with a best quality cotton or microfiber polishing cloth.When you're done with the 3M hand glazing process, your paint will be at its best - silky smooth and contaminant free.  It will shine as best as it knows how - but you're not finished.  This is a polish, not a protectant wax.

Dremel makes a small, cone-shaped, red-stone bit. It's head is 5mm wide at the base and 8.5 long. I don't know the item number. It is tiny. Under a magnified florescent work lamp, I lightly ground the three crescent-shaped, spring-loaded clamps that grab the grease fitting, careful to maintain the original contour. This took about two minutes. I'd lightly graze all three clamps and then test the connection. I left the coupler a little tight allowing for future wear. This grease gun is top quality. After a two-minute modification, it is now a customized tool. Guys like to customized cars, motorcycles and guns, why not their tools?

It does have a bit of abrasiveness to it, so I wouldn't recommend using it on newer finishes.  It works ideally on older, imperfect finishes.I have a 12 year old car which I used to be very avid about keeping cleaned, vacuumed, and waxed.  Over the years I have gotten more lax about keeping the car up, even though it still looks decent.  Being outside all the time has slowly worn away the clear coat on the car, so the finish oxidizes fairly easily now.  The proper way to handle this would be a multi-stage polishing, followed by a good wax or sealant. Done correctly this takes hours and is quite tedious - even with an orbital polisher.  With this product you effectively reduce those 2-3 steps down to one.  It does an admirable job of reducing watermarks, stains, and oxidation while leaving a nice shine and protective wax coating.It can be applied easily by hand, though you'll get the maximum cleaning and polishing effect from using an orbital buffer.  It dries quickly and wipes off easily by hand.

The paint was not in too bad a shape as I always used the 2 bucket hand wash method. Just light swirling on my grabber blue paint. To prepare the surface I washed the car then used Meguiar's clay bar to remove any embedded matter in the paint. Surprising what is in there after only 2 years even though the paint looked clean to the naked eye. After the claying I got out the Porter Cable polisher. Since this is an orbital polisher it is good for anyone who is new to using a power tool on your paint. This was my first time. It was quite simple actually. I mentally divided the hood into 5 section and did one at a time putting an X pattern on the Meguiar's polishing pad with the #9 Swirl remover. I did 4 section passes on each area and then used a microfiber towel to take off the excess polish. I could immediately see that the pad I used (Meguiar's 6.5-Inch Soft Buff Foam Polishing Pad) was just enough to do an excellent job. You see, since the paint was only 2 years old I didn't need a too aggressive polish, or a pad that cut too much. So if your car is in similar condition this may be a good combination for you. This I guess is why you do a test are first and not the whole car. After I was satisfied that this was the right combination, I moved on and finished the car. If it did not do the trick, I could use more pressure, a more aggressive pad, ramp up the speed on the polisher (I used setting 5 for this) or maybe bought a more aggressive polish. I really liked this stuff. Quite easy to do and I wasn't afraid that the polish would burn through my clear coat. I finished it up with Meguiar's liquid Ultimate Wax.

I located a mechanics model in a catalog and ordered it there.  I found it to be far more versatile with its long stem conductor instead of the flat plastic head on a physicians model, as well as much easier to use by design.  About a year ago my old stethoscope got run over during one of my more intense repairs, and I have since picked up this very same Lisle model from a local parts store.  The price here on Amazon for this 52500 model is cheaper than what I paid, and at the time of this writing ships free when bundled.  Although there are more expensive models available on Amazon, I cannot imagine anyone needing anything more than what this one offers.  Its solid, durable, and very comfortable to wear.I should point out that a mechanics stethoscope is one of the most versatile tools you can own. Even if you never do any work on cars.

In addition to cars, you can easily locate squeaks or noises in any kind of machinery, or in your homes floor and walls. I even used mine to locate an irritating squeak on a neighbors sewing machine.  It is very easy to use, and even a lot of fun at times.As for this model versus a higher priced one, unless you're a highly paid specialist of some kind that prefers the very best, I would pass up the more expensive scopes available here or anywhere else and buy this one.  It is all the scope most of us should ever need, and one of the most handy and versatile tools to have in your home or garage.....

Again, it is extremely sensitive to sounds, even touching any part of it produces a lot of sounds, so keep that in mind when you use it.

The towel came out more black than with other products, which I assume indicates it is removing a lot of oxidized black rubber/trim.Unfortunately, this product does NOT last.  I covered all the rubber/plastic on my car (two thorough coats), let it soak in/settle for a day, then washed it to get the overwipe/streaks of nearby body panels, etc.  The Meguiar's #40 washed completely off.  It was left worse than before I used the product.  The finish remaining was also very splotchy and looks bad.  Even some interior parts that I applied #40 to were mostly wiped clean after just wiping with a damp towel used to pick up accumulated dust/dirt.  It remained splotchy where there were minor nicks scratches in the plastic/rubber where more #40 had absorbed.Overall, I was very unsatisfied with the results.  I'm not going to say it is the worst product I have ever used, but others that I use are far and away better.  These include 303 Aerospace Protectant which is a very mild, water-based product which also doesn't last but is better than this Meguiars product and has almost no sheen.My previous staple and which I recommend most is actually Armor All Original.  I purchased a Guru Reports analysis on these types of products several years ago and was surprised that this \"old\" product was one of the two best-in-category products (along with Zaino) among over 50 that were tested.  Armor All Original (not other formulations) is very low sheen and also lasts several washes.  It is also about 1/4 the price or less and available everywhere.I'm going back to Armor All Original and recommend that you try it as it performs better than \"boutique\" products.  I would also recommend that you use water-based products on permanent trim, rubber, etc., as the solvent/petroleum-based ones have a tendency to degrade the rubber/plastic over time.  These may be OK for replaceable items like tires or parts that are severely oxidized.  You can generally tell the difference in that water-based products are milky color while the petroleum-based ones are clear.

I can't just push or lift my selector valve to operate it.  No, I have to twist it while pushing/pulling like a madman, and hope I don't break anything (including my fingers).  I was able to loosen it up somewhat by spraying the valve with silicone/Teflon spray, and operating it repeatedly.

It's just a poor-fitting device.The tube connector where the main evacuation tube enters the top of the unit leaked when I put it in dispense mode.  I had to pay over $27 to get a replacement \"Tube Connector Kit\" (822566), since my unit is out of warranty.After replacing the tube connector and trying dispense mode again, I found that the top plate leaks.

It worked, so why bother with taking the lid off.I tested the evaucation action by drawing a gallon of antifreeze inside the 7201. It did this quickly with only a few pumps of the handle. So far so good.Next, I tested the refilling capability by returning the antifreeze back into the one gallon container.  It did this quickly and very throughly leaving only about 1 oz in the botton of the reservoir.

For my Crown Vic, and my pre-80's cars, it's simply outstanding.It pulls an amazing amount of oil from the pan, just have to fish around a little with the hose after you get most of the oil out, in order to find any small pockets of oil remaining.  After about 3-4 minutes of suction, I removed the drain plug and checked.  I only got a tablespoon or so of drip, which is pretty good, overall.  Transmission oil is just as easy, but I think you'd be better off slightly elevating the front/rear/side in order to force fluid toward the dipstick because the pans are usually flatter/shallower.Quick, easy, and you can just pump it right back into the empty oil container.  You're still going to get some on you...Finally, my one complaint, there is no way to securely fasten the hose and adapter fittings to the pump when it's not in use.  Minor, but irritating, since the little friction clip is pretty much useless if you bump the hose out.  The fittings disappeared into the garage somewhere, since I set them aside while I pumped out the oil.

Although I am well experienced with cars, I currently have my oilpan drain plug replaced with a temperature sensor, so I prefer not to remove that and risk damaging, plus, I hate having to get under the car and pray not to spill oil everywhere.The Pela pump was great, the big issue was that there was no easy way to drain the container and if you weren't careful, while draining you would tip too far and cause an air bubble which made oil dump out with some force and splash everywhere (think of turning a 2liter bottle upside down).  Unfortunately I had to toss out the pump because it was starting to leak some oil out of the handle.I read some great things on automotive forums about the Mityvac, and was ecstatic to find this particular model that can not only pump, but easily evacuate fluid as well.  This comes in real handy when dealing with fluids such as brake fluid and transmission fluid.  On top of that, it provided me a VERY easy way to extract oil from the pump back into the bottles ;).The pump worked like a charm, and did exactly what it is intended to do.  This is great for my car because although the car holds about 5 quarts of oil, conventional draining from the pan only drains out about 4 quarts as oil is still left in the oil coolers.  Because of the vacuum that this produces inside of the oil sump, I manage to evacuate almost every drop of oil from the system.One note is that you MUST tighten the screws holding on the top cover.

It includes everything you need and works pretty well, although sicking up 4-5 quarts can be a little slow, so be patient. I use it for oil changes so I don't need to always undo the drain plug and replace the compression washer (don't forget to replace the filter too!). I've heard so many horror stories about damage to the threads on the oil pan drain plug from over tightening that I decided to reduce the number of times I go there. That's where this Fluid Evacuator comes in. Warm up the engine a little, turn everything off, slip the straw like hose down the dip stick hole and suck up the oil. Change the filer and refill the oil and you're done. For me that means I don't have to remove panels under the car to access the oil pan drain plug and I don't have to put the car up on stands. Those both take a lot of time, so this evacuator is a great time saver. The tank is big enough to hold the oil from my larger car's engine and when the tank is full, the Mityvac can be put into reverse and pump out the contents too, so you don't need to pour out the tank.It includes several different diameter &#34;straws&#34; that are designed to slip down the dipstick hole or other filler holes (like on a differential). Those straws connect to clear piping so the Evacuator can be standing on the garage floor.Remember that oil and similar liquids flow best when warm. However, don't get the fluids hot and don't run the motor with the straw inserted! I read about someone who did that and the meshing gears pulled the straw into them, causing the motor to stall and needed to take apart the engine to get the straw out!!About my only complaint with the Evacuator is I wish it had more strays since I'd also like to drain the radiators using this but don't want to use the oily motor oil straw where oil isn't wanted in the radiator. Otherwise this is a great tool to have available.

They did NOT come with aiming instructions, which seems silly, if you ask me (but, who asked me, right!).If you've ever searched the web for headlight aiming instructions, good luck! No two are alike! I contacted the manufacturer of the bulbs, and even they had vague instructions. This is the best explanation I found: [...]Step one ... put some gas in the tank. The adjustment will fluctuate a little depending on how much gas you have in the tank (yes, I did it on empty the first time and had to re-adjust the height.), and other load/spring/shock conditions.On a flat surface, you drive the car as close as you can up to a wall and mark the center of the headlight beams. This varies from bulb to bulb, and can range from a well defined rectangle, to a somewhat defined \"top,\" and a vague \"bottom.\" Some bulbs have a kind of a \"z\" that you align where is zigs and zags.Now, back your vehicle up 25'. This is an \"industry rule of thumb,\" not a mystery, as some manufacturers may have you believe. My lights were shining on the ground at this point, waaaay off!On the back of your lights are little screws with 4 mm hex heads. The top ones towards the outside of the car are for up and down, the lower ones, towards the inside of the car, are for left and right. I tried pliers ... no good, I tried that little crescent wrench ... no good, I went to Sears and bought that pretty miniature set of metric wrenches that goes down to 4 mm for $20 (what was I thinking) ... and I was actually able to do some adjusting by turning and turning the wrench, back and forth, back and forth, dropping it into the frame ... (you know what I'm talkin' 'bout!) ... I did discover (if you're short of cash and have a little wrench already) that by taking the yellow bulb assembly out of the headlight, that the little wrench will spin around without taking it off the post.Since my daughter and I both have these cars, I decided to look for a \"real\" adjustment tool and found this Lisle product. WOW! Now, I can do BOTH headlights, up and down, AND, right and left, in the time it took me to do one screw before! This thing fits perfectly, it ratchets smoothly, and you can pop it on and off easily! It's like a miracle tool! NOTE TO SELF!!! DO \"NOT\" BACK THE ADJUSTER SCREW ALL THE WAY TO THE METAL PANEL BEHIND IT WITH THE TOOL ON THE SCREW! THE TOOL WON'T COME OFF AND YOU CAN'T REVERSE THE TOOL OTHER THAN TO REMOVE IT FROM THE SCREW AND TURN IT AROUND! And, no, I didn't actually do this, but I came darn close!K, I digress, sorry about that! Now, you have your car backed up 25' from the wall, hood open, radiator access panel removed (there's a little thumb screw you turn if you're lucky). Lights on \"low beam,\" then cover one of the lights with a dark towel or something, and it will be easier to see the light you're working on.Vertical adjustment (up and down) ... At this point there are several variations of \"the rule.\" I have found on my car that aligning the \"top\" on the headlight pattern at, or just below, the horizontal centerline for the lights that I marked on the wall is good. This is pretty easy to see for any of the bulbs that I have been using.Horizontal adjustment (side to side) ... This varies a lot! The recommendations in the link in this post has you align the \"driver's side\" of the beam rectangles (this varies from aligning the centerline of the beam rectangles to two inches to the right of the centerline in some recommendations, and various other recommendations), just up to the vertical centerlines that we marked on the wall. IF you can actually see a definite outline of the beans, this might work. On one car, the beams are defined, on the other I can NOT see a defined left or right edge on the wall, so I had to \"play it by ear\" and eyeball the adjusters so as to not get them too far in or out, erring on what I thought to be aiming the beams more to the passenger side of the centerlines. Keep in mind that the goal is to illuminate the shoulder, passenger side of the road, the lane you are traveling in, and, I believe, to illuminate somewhat, the oncoming lane without blinding the other driver.Commonsense, and a test drive will tell you if you have it right. If the street signs are glowing like the sun from a mile down the road, you're aimed too high! A quick check of the high beams while in front of the wall may verify your aim. You do NOT adjust high beams, they are supposed to be \"self-aiming\" when the low beams are aimed, however, they should be somewhat centered over those centerlines we marked earlier.The glory of this tool was then, when I did the test run with the radiator access cowling off already, and I could see the beam was too far towards the driver's side (middle) of the road, I just pulled off the road, opened the hood and popped the adjusting tool on the screw, easily flipped it a few turns (you will know which way after you adjust it a few times) and it came out perfect!Please verify all information, this can be dangerous for everyone if it's not done correctly.

I called a \"local and official\" state lamp adjusment shop and they quoted me $80 to adjust the two new headlamp assemblies I bought on E-Bay for $50. Right. So I tried to adjust them myself but it was very difficult and time consuming. I bought this tool from a local Napa Auto Parts store. The tool worked OK but unfortunately because the head is so big, it would only turn to a certain extent before being stopped by the other metal piece to the rear of the headlamp assembly unit. Another reviewer below mentioned the same problem. So in the end, the tool was really useless because I could not use it to completely turn the small screws all the way back towards the rear.

A number of people say the gauge on this is too small.  I don't think the numbers on the gauge are much smaller than on the ARB Blue, but the Milton's gauge does feel harder to read.  I think it has more to do with the gauge being deeply inset behind thick glass/oil so light doesn't penetrate quite as easily as on the ARB's gauge, and the fact its measurement line is silver metal instead of bright red like the needle in the ARB's gauge.  Using a silver metal line is just stupid because it's a low contrast against a white background and black text and the silver partly reflects white light depending on how light strikes it making it even harder to see.  I think whoever designed this gauge \"back in the day\" decided it was somehow perfect and never needed any tweaks despite user complaints and other companies coming up with some better ideas.The junction between the red hose and gold pipe rotates which is nice if you want to push the filler against the tire at a convenient angle and still read the gauge.  The ARB doesn't have that feature which can leave its gauge hard to read because on a lot of tires you can only clip the hose on at a certain angle.One of the reviewers said the gauge measured pressure as you filled the tire, but that isn't true.  The gauge goes to zero while you fill, just like every other tire filler I've ever used, and only measures when you're not filling.  The gauge itself measured an identical value to a hand-held gauge I've been using forever.The description says the Milton has a \"dual chuck\" which I thought maybe meant you could rotate the silver end to press either side to the tire and one side might be made to connect to a different style of air connection.  But the silver part does not rotate and the air connection on both sides is identical.  I got the impression from another review that having a connection on the other side is useful if you have to push the hose into a tight space and pull the chuck back onto an air connection.The ARB comes with a type D quick disconnect already screwed in but on the Milton you have to supply your own sealing tape and screw in your own quick disconnect (ieLegacy A73457D Color Connex Type D 7 Piece 1/4 in. Red Coupler and Plug Kit).The ARB has a button you can use to release pressure from what you're inflating but the Milton has no such feature.  I don't think it's at all difficult to release some pressure on the chuck and just let air escape from the tire and that's probably easier than using a pressure-release button anyway.  Plus having a button creates another point that can fail during manufacture or after you've owned the tool for awhile.Despite the shortcomings, the Milton is much more solidly constructed than the ARB and the hose doesn't leak.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Gauge a little hard to read, great otherwise", "unixReviewTime": 1354060800, "reviewTime": "11 28, 2012"}

I told him it was almost 4 years old and he could not believe it. I have to admit that the car does look like due to wonderful Mothers products and some elbow grease.Mothers Carnauba Wax is one of the weapons in keeping my car looking good.I start by washing my car. I don't dry it as this time as water drops will be removed by other steps. Then I clay the car to remove embedded specs, stuck on dirt, and this year I had rubber marks from clearing the snowMothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System. I don't clay every inch of the entire car. I just examine the car by sight for any imperfections and by my running my hand over the paint to feel any tiny bumps. When I feel some grittiness or see some dirt on the paint, I generously spray that section with Mothers Showtime Instant Detailer, then knead the piece of clay in my hand and rub it against the spot I identified. Normally, you see the dirt disappear in a few swipes. Sometimes you need to reapply the Detailer and repeat. Kneading is important as you want to work the little pieces of dirt into the clay, and not leave it on the surface of the clay ball where it can scratch the car. I also use the clay on non-painted areas such as glass and chrome if they have stains.After the claying step I wax the car is small sections using Carnauba Wax. It easy to work with.  I put it on a small section (each side of the car is done in 4 sections, for example), by the time I am done spreading it, it is ready to be wiped off, you don't have to wait.  I use micro fiber towels to wipe the wax, using a fresh piece of the fiber on each section.As my final step I apply Back-to-blackMothers 06108 Back-To-Black - 8 ozto non-painted surfaces. This turns the dull plastic into shiny new looking surface. Back-to-black is also effective in removing any wax that might have accidently got on the plastic, that's why I do back-to-black as the last step.Carnauba Wax gives a superior shine.

Since then, the car has set under the carport, uncovered, collecting dirt and grime. Its only use has been to serve as our cats \"perch\". You can hardly imagine how tired and run-down it looked. Truthfully, I was skeptical... but a friend who does auto detailing told me to give the Mothers three-step product a try. So based on that recommendation, I ordered it through Amazon as it was not available locally. I was excited to see what the old buggy could look like.I soon found out one thing - This product takes a lot of rubbing. After rinsing the car off (it doesn't run yet, so I just sponged it off) to get the worst of the grime off, then set to work with the cleaner. I also purchased the Mothers 4 Paint ball and used that in my drill along with lots of rubbing with some old fluffy athletic socks.First coat done: and the results were nothing short of amazing; However, some haze was still visible. So I applied a second coat of cleaner. That one went on much easier, and following the final hand rub, the haze was gone.I wish that I could post photos here for you to see the before and after - Only photos could demonstrate what this product, preceded by the step 1 cleaner, and step 2 sealer has done.Since the car had been virtually unprotected for nearly 30 years, and exposed to wind, temperature extremes, and blowing rain and snow, there were quite a few surface rust bubbles peeking through the paint. They still remain (after all, it's an old car with completely original paint). But that's okay - The Mothers three step product did its job and I am a happy camper.The only recommendation I would have is to buy two bottls of cleaner if you have a car in a similar condition. I ran short and had to buy a second bottle. In my mind, that's a small price to pay.The system is also available as a complete 3-step kit called the Ultimate Wax System.

It's a Cadillac CTS, and the only black areas are around the front and rear fascia, and the door pillars. But these black plastic parts had begun to fade after about 2 years. The car is even garage kept most of the time. Many of the black trim restoring products on Amazon have a wide range of reviews; from 1 to 5 stars for most if not every similar product. I chose Mothers because I use many of their other products, typically with good results. Back to Black did not disappoint. I applied it to the plastic trim around the fascia using \"12pcs Waxing Polish Wax Foam Sponge Applicator Pads Fit for Clean Car Vehicle Auto Glass High_quality Yellow Useful NEW\" (from Amazon) which are ideal for this task. Mothers instructions state that the area should be buffed after application. I found buffing unnecessary on the trim around the fascia. I did try buffing at first, but these areas are somewhat rough-textured and seemed to absorb the liquid fairly quickly. Buffing did not change the appearance.However, on the door pillars, the texture is smooth and buffing did make a appreciable difference there. Buffing with a soft towel helped to more evenly distribute the Back to Black, eliminating some minor streaking resulting from application. Buffing also improved the gloss of the black color, which would have been more like flat black prior to buffing. So whether to buff or not depends on the type of material where the product is being applied. Back to Black is also very good at removing any excess wax that gets on the fascia trim areas.Most of the negative reviews of this and similar black detailing products are because they need periodic reapplication. I found this to be true also of Back to Black. But no black detailer is going to be a miracle product and last forever.

Mothers did a great job restoring my trim back to black.My trim was very dry and It absorbed so much product that I used the whole bottle and didn't get to the mud flaps and the running boards (which were not as bad as the trim around the bed and cab of the truck). A couple of things impressed me, it really evened out the blemishes and brought all the trim to a consistent black color.  This was extremely evident around the bed of the truck where part of flat areas are expose and some flats areas are protected by deck lids (on the various compartments), which when opened revealed a sharp line between the two areas.  After applying back to black you could not tell the difference, the trim was even in color and shine. It looked brand new...  Impressive, indeed.But just to say out loud, it's important to work back to black into the sun baked dry parts.  if it is really dry, like mine was, you may have to hit it several times.  That's the key, get the rag saturated with the product and keep working it in until the trim cannot absorb any more.  Once you've reached that point, go back with a clean dry towel and wipe off the excess and buff it so that the shine is in the trim and not from the excess product on the trim.  Don't go by sight, feel the trim with your hand until there is no excess product on it... keep drying and buffing until the trim shines on its own.  If you don't, you'll get streaking.

Since then, the car has set under the carport, uncovered, collecting dirt and grime.  Its only use has been to serve as our cats \"perch\".  You can hardly imagine how tired and run-down it looked.  Truthfully, I was skeptical... but a friend who does auto detailing told me to give the Mothers three-step product a try.  So based on that recommendation, I ordered it through Amazon as it was not available locally.  I was excited to see what the old buggy could look like.I soon found out one thing - This product takes a lot of rubbing.  After rinsing the car off (it doesn't run yet, so I just sponged it off) to get the worst of the grime off, then set to work with the cleaner.  I also purchased the Mothers 4 Paint ball and used that in my drill along with lots of rubbing with some old fluffy athletic socks.First coat done: and the results were nothing short of amazing; However, some haze was still visible.  So I applied a second coat of cleaner.  That one went on much easier, and following the final hand rub, the haze was gone.I wish that I could post photos here for you to see the before and after - Only photos could demonstrate what this product, followed by the step 2 sealer, and step 3 carnuba wax has done.Since the car had been virtually unprotected for nearly 30 years, and exposed to wind, temperature extremes, and blowing rain and snow, there were quite a few surface rust bubbles peeking through the paint.  They still remain (after all, it's an old car with completely original paint).  But that's okay - The Mothers three step product did its job and I am a happy camper.The only recommendation I would have is to buy two bottls of cleaner if you have a car in a similar condition.  I ran short and had to buy a second bottle.  In my mind, that's a small price to pay.The system is also available as a complete 3-step kit called the Ultimate Wax System.

I tried waxing which made the car shiny but the scars still remained, it only covered the lightest of scratches at most.Review:Then by looking up any new clay bar kits i happened to see amazon recommend a 3 step from mothers car care products. I didnt know about sealants, and after reading it i bought the whole kit and was surprised. step one cleaned well enough, but step 2 made those pesky scratches less noticeable, only I would see them since I know where they are. the deeper ones are still their but the glaze makes it so shiny its hard to focus on the scratches, which are usually the focus of a car.

Mothers step 3 California gold wax (if you arent a mothers fan for wax you can use any you like ontop of the glaze) Personally i like mothers wax, its shines well and easy to apply. I will wait to review the wax because I want to see its durability and water beading properties.

So based on that recommendation, I ordered it through Amazon as it was not available locally.  I was excited to see what the old buggy could look like.I soon found out one thing - This product takes a lot of rubbing.  After rinsing the car off (it doesn't run yet, so I just sponged it off) to get the worst of the grime off, then set to work with the cleaner.  I also purchased the Mothers 4 Paint ball and used that in my drill along with lots of rubbing with some old fluffy athletic socks.First coat done: and the results were nothing short of amazing; However, some haze was still visible.  So I applied a second coat of cleaner.  That one went on much easier, and following the final hand rub, the haze was gone.I wish that I could post photos here for you to see the before and after - Only photos could demonstrate what this product, followed by the step 2 sealer, and step 3 carnuba wax has done.Since the car had been virtually unprotected for nearly 30 years, and exposed to wind, temperature extremes, and blowing rain and snow, there were quite a few surface rust bubbles peeking through the paint.  They still remain (after all, it's an old car with completely original paint).  But that's okay - The Mothers three step product did its job and I am a happy camper.The only recommendation I would have is to buy two bottls of cleaner if you have a car in a similar condition.  I ran short and had to buy a second bottle.  In my mind, that's a small price to pay.I will be posting this same review under the step two and step three products to help anyone who may miss this particular review.

If I'm not mistaken it is either a very mild type of car polish and may contain abrasives. Basically it will smooth out your cars surface, and make it shiny from the clear coat surface. I think it did a fair job making it shine and removing surface residue from the clay and detailer. It did an okay job so far with very light swirlmarks. since I am unfamiliar with other polishing compounds that I have been hearing about I will give this product of 3.5 rounded to 4 stars. just because I like it enough for the ease of use/money/amount and ending result.

Since then I clay my car twice a year, in the spring  and the the fall.I just finished my spring treatment when a fellow walked by my car and asked if this was 2011 CRV that I waswashing.  I told him it was almost 4 years old and he could not believe it.  I have toadmit that the car does look like new with much of the credit to regular claying and using back-to-blackon plastic parts.I should mention that I store Gold Clay in a plastic container which used to contain onion dip.  This keeps it pliable and clean.  It is a bit strange that the container for clay did not come with the package.  If clay dries out it will stop working. And it is sticky, so if you leave it without some sort of container it will pick up dirt that could scratch the car the next time you use it.Claying system removes contaminants that attach themselves to the car. Clay does not polish the car or remove any paint of finish, so it is totally safe to the finish if used properly (i.e. with plenty of lubrication).The clay material (which feels like play-doh)makes the small particulars that are deposited on the car finish attach themselves to the clay and get lifted from the car finish. Clay needs to be used with heavy lubrication, which Showtime Instant Detailer, included in this package, provides.I start by washing my car. I don't dry it as this time as water drops will be removed by other steps. Then I clay the car. I don't clay every inch of the entire car. I just examine the car by sight for any imperfections and by my running my hand over the paint to feel any tiny bumps. When I feel some grittiness or see some dirt on the paint, I generously spray that section with Showtime Instant Detailer, then knead the piece of clay in my hand and rub it against the spot I identified. Normally, you see the dirt disappear in a few swipes.  Sometimes you need to reapply the Detailer and repeat.  Kneading is important as you want to work the little pieces of dirt into the clay, and not leave it on the surface of the clay ball where it can scratch the car. This year we had a rough winter and I had some rubber marks from my snow removal tool in addition to the regular dirt specs.

I hadn't done much with paint care for more than a couple years and one side was covered in small, hard, brown tree sap spots.  Reading the reviews on Amazon (and other websites) for clay bars and their use in cleaning up paint surfaces, I thought I'd try this Mother's kit to revitalize my paint job.  I was sceptical about its abilities to do anything other than a final \"fine cleaning\".  I was right.The clay bar could not remove any of the hard tree sap marks.  It does not remove scratches (and can actually apply some if you do not keep the clay lubricated.  It does make the paint seem smoother to the touch, but I cannot tell the difference between a final normally waxed and polished surface and a clayed waxed and polished surface.  The surface feel of unpolished paint Vs clayed paint does exhibit a noticeable benefit from claying, as the makers claim.  However, applying a good polish achieves the same results on a washed and clean paint surface, in my opinion.  Even on my truck, after cleaning it first, the clay stayed pretty clean and only after doing the whole vehicle paint surface did the clay feel faintly gritty and appear slightly darker in color - ready for trashing.To remove the sap, I resorted to a rag soaked in mineral spirits and plenty of elbow grease.  To eliminate any light scratches, I used T-Cut.  Then I clayed it, followed by polishing with Turtle Wax.  After a day of that, my shoulders ached bad, but the truck paintwork looks good; well, as good as an 11 year old, well-used, stone-chipped and scratched truck can.  The clearcoat has actually held up exceedingly well over the years.I haven't tried clay on our 3 year old, garaged minivan yet.  It will be interesting to see if it removes minor swirl marks.  I don't expect it to make the paint look any shinier after polishing. It looks great as it is.I did buy an extra bottle of detailing spray (I bought the kit locally at Autozone) in case one wasn't enough.  But one was enough for one clay bar / one vehicle treatment.  Since there are two clay bars in the kit, then the extra bottle will be used with the second bar.I found the claying to be easy and quite quick.  I split the bar in two, then pressed it flat into a disc about 2\" in diameter.  Then I sprayed the surface and rubbed the clay back and forth over the paint in my palm.  Knead it regularly back into the 2\" disc, as it gets thinner and splits.  It was actually very straightforward and no big deal.  Avoid rubber parts, like the windshield surround, as the clay picked up black \"soot\" from those.  Make sure you polish it dry as the spray leaves streaks if you don't remove it with the supplied towelI suggest clay bars are really for the guys and gals that want the ultimate care for their newer vehicles.  It may not be noticed by anyone else, but it's the satisfaction of a job well done that always matters to the perfectionist!  I know 'cos I am one!Sept 26 2009 UPDATE:  This evening, I tried claying half the hood of my minivan then waxing it all to see if I could tell any difference.  The clearcoat on the van is in great condition.  I washed the hood and dried it.  Then I clayed the left half (LH as seated in the van).  I did notice that even with plenty of spray lubricant there were a few faint straight line, light scratches visible in the clearcoat after I wiped the surface dry that weren't there before claying.  I could not feel any real difference in the surface smoothness from the clayed to the unclayed side. The clay appeared to have no visible dirt in it.  I then Turtle Wax'd the whole hood.  After that, the straight line scratches were gone and there was no VISUAL difference from clayed to unclayed even with the reflected overhead flourescent light from my garage as a guide.  I then applied my dry finger tips to the hood; left hand on the unclayed side and right hand on the clayed side.  Applying a light pressure and sliding back and forth, I think I detected a slight reduction in friction as the fingers change direction on the clayed side.  Even swapping hands over, the result seemed the same, ruling out differences in my finger tips!  However, the effect was so slight that it was almost imperceptible.CONCLUSION:  Claying may help with a contaminated paint surface to remove those last little imperfections and revive the paint, but with a clean and regularly-waxed paint surface, claying probably isn't worth the cost nor the effort.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Claying is more for the perfectionist", "unixReviewTime": 1253750400, "reviewTime": "09 24, 2009"}

Plenty of the included spray detailer must be used or else the clay will stick to the car. I personally don't rub too aggressively, and I don't believe that is necessary. After the clay the residue is wiped away with a microfiber cloth. While you can leave the car as is, it is a really good idea to put on a coat of wax immediately after claying the car. You will be amazed at how smooth and slick the car's paint will be after just claying, and with the wax it'll feel like you greased the surface. The results can be incredible if you are patient and follow the directions. The only thing to remember is that if the clay bar ever falls on the ground it must be thrown away.

I once had a car assigned to me for two years, but other than that I've only had single day rentals.  So of course, in the honeymoon stage with my 2007 Honda Element, I wanted to make it look as beautiful as possible before showing it off to my family at Thanksgiving.So I went to a local pro detailer.  To hand wash and vacuum out the car it would be $25; to clay bar the car and do the wash it's $75; full detailing cost $150.  That's pretty decent, and I wouldn't mind paying to have the pro do the job, but for $18 I wanted to try clay barring it myself.The instructions couldn't be simpler, though I would add that you should at least rinse off the car and let it air dry for a few minutes before starting to clay bar.  You don't have to be particularly gentle or slow about it, and don't worry about getting the chamois dirty--you can wash it or just get another one for cheap.Just spray, rub, wipe it down with the cloth, and move on to the next spot until you've done the whole car.  Don't worry about getting into ever single little nook and cranny.  I imagine even the pros don't bother with that unless they're literally working on a showpiece.Trust me, you couldn't fail to be happy with the results, and for $18 why not try.When you're finished clay barring the car, take it to a car wash for a nice wash and wax (or do that yourself as well) and see the gorgeous results.  The car will look as new as it possibly could.Lastly, I want to dispell a myth about clay barring.  I heard--from a pro amongst others--that what clay barring does is reverse the oxydization of the paint which makes the finish dull, amongst other wierd science theories.  That's rediculous; car wax does that.  All clay barring does is pick up tiny bits of stuff--airborn metal specks, asphalt dust, microscopic bits of rock, space debris--which have become embedded in the paint.  That's it.  It's basically just removing the millions of tiny little splinters of stuff that have lodged themselves into the paint since it was new or the last time it was clay barred.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Requires no skill or experience whatsoever.

Use the saved money to buy a nice bottle of car wash.At first I was hesitant to use soapy water instead of the detailer spray that came with it, but after some research I discovered that many professional detailers use soapy water (there are YouTube vids with professionals using soap suds for claying). I even did a test at first, using soapy water on one area and the detail spray on another, and the clay process worked just as well with soap (or auto shampoo, rather). Just be sure the water is very sudsy and constantly applied. I wound up using the Showtime spray to clay about half the car, and I nearly used up the entire bottle. Maybe I used too much, but I only sprayed enough to cover the surface (a 2010 Accord), and with something like this I figure too much lubricant is better than too little. Detailing spray isn't exactly expensive, but using the spray instead of soap could easily result in adding $5-$10 to the task. If it offered better performance over soapy water, that would be one thing, but it doesn't seem to.Before washing the car I tried using the spray alone as a detailer on a lightly dusty surface, and it cleaned well. I wish I had just used soapy water for the entire clay process and saved the detail spray for its original purpose. In that sense, this kit is probably a nice value along with the microfiber cloth (also pretty nice quality). I can't comment on the quality of the clay bar since it's the only one I've used. It was soft and didn't fall apart. I didn't see the huge amount of contaminants on the bar like you see in some customer photos (hardly any, really, but maybe my contaminants were of the transparent sort), but it definitely had an impact on surface smoothness.It was a good learning experience and good value considering everything it comes with. However, in the future I'll buy a separate clay bar. Mothers does sell the bar separately, also, and reviews seem to suggest its quality is competitive.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Next time, soapy water", "unixReviewTime": 1383350400, "reviewTime": "11 2, 2013"}

It seemed that the dirt and grime had gotten lodged in the paint and wouldn't budge no matter how hard I tried washing the car. After every car wash, I would run my fingers through the paint and it would still feel gritty.That was when I learned about Mothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System Kit. The results were astounding! After using it, the paint no longer felt gritty but glassy-smooth. The paint was no longer dulled by contaminants and the car looked like it had a new coat of paint! I was immensely pleased with the results.Unlike a lot of car polish or polishing compounds that use abrasion to strip away surface contaminants, auto clay simply picks up surface contaminants and locks them into the clay. The clay looks and feels exactly like plasticine (Play-doh) and it is used along with the included \"lubricant\" spray (actually, an auto soap that provide lots of suds -- like Meguiar's Gold Class -- will work equally well.)Mind you, car polish still has its place in paint restoration because claying will not remove scratches; only a car polish or a polishing compound (harsher) can do that. And remember, always follow the claying with an application of wax to shield your paint from new contaminants. Also, clay your car every so often and you will keep the paint looking like new!I am giving Mothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System Kit my highest recommendation. Go on, try it and see for yourself firsthand the difference it makes in your car paint.

This worked, but it was pretty time consuming, and required a lot of care, so I decided to try Mothers California Gold clay bar kit.  The kit contains two bars of clay, a microfiber towel, and a spray bottle of Showtime Instant Detailer.I found that while the clay product does a pretty good job of removing dirt, sap, and small particles, adhering to the paint finish, it doesn't do much for removing paint spots.  For the uninitiated, using this product effectively requires developing a certain technique, particularly if you have a thick layer of gunk on your finish.Firstly, the surface you are treating should be cleaned of surface dirt, and cool.  The Instant Detailer spray is pretty slippery, and there is very little friction when sliding the clay bar across a surface sprayed with this stuff.  What you want to try to do is have a thin layer of the Detailer solution on the area, so you can slide the clay over the surface, but still get enough friction so the clay can pickup and remove particles from the finish.  If you have never done this before, it may take some trial and error to develop a technique that works.Since the clay is soft, it is constantly changing its shape as you use it, and from time to time, you will need to reshape it.  One thing to be very aware of, is not getting any debris into the clay.  If you accidentally drop the clay on the ground and happen to get a small rock, piece of metal, or other hard substance stuck in the clay, you could do some major damage to your finish, if you use the clay.  I store the clay in a small zip lock bag, and always be sure to have a zip lock with me when working, to try and keep the clay from picking up something that could be destructive.The bottom line is that the product works pretty well, but you will probably need to have a decent technique, and plenty of muscle to get the job done.  The process is not a simple spray on and wipe off, it will require some time and physical effort to do an entire vehicle.  The clay works on all kinds of finishes, but probably produces the best results on smoother finishes, as there is less friction.

About a month ago when I just finished my pre-winter car cleaning ritual a neighbor walked by and ask me if it was a new car shining in my drive way.  That's when you know the wax did its job well.Meguiar Gold Liquid Wax not only does a great job, it is easy to work with if you follow simple steps below:WASHI wash the car first using a detergent designed for car washing, as it removes the grime better. I use microfiber towels to wash.  What you use to wash makes a big difference, a good micro fiber towel makes the job go faster and it does a good job with the smallest amount of effort.BE COOLI wash either in the shade or in the evening when the sun is not strong. Strong sun will dry out the water too soon and working with dry finish can lead to small abrasions. Hot paint finish is also easier to damage. So I make sure the car is cool while I am working on it. I wash the top of the car, then the bottom of the car.  I don't want dirty water streaming down on the clean portions.DRYThen I dry the car which helps remove whatever dirt might have remained on the car after the wash.  I use more micro fiber towels.  I like Costco's micro fiber towel bag, for $10 you get a big bag of high quality towels of just the right size.CLAYI check the car for any dirt that the water did not take off and clay those areas.  I don't clay the entire car, just the areas where I see imperfections.WAXI apply the wax to another micro fiber towel, spread it on a small portion of the car (3 feet by 3 feet), then wipe it off with another micro fiber towel.  If you let the wax sit too long it will become difficult to buff off, that's why working on small areas is better.  If I drop a towel, I move on to the next one.  Even tiny dirt particles you can't see will scratch the paint surface.  I try avoid getting wax on plastic parts.  If I do get it on the plastic parts, see \"back to black\" described below.BACK To BLACKThe final step is to apply Back to black solution to plastic parts of the car.  It makes the plastic look new, and it is not harmful to the painted surfaces. Back to black solution effectively removes any wax residue you might have gotten on to the plastic parts, it also takes care of the sun damage to the plastic.This procedure takes me about an hour.

Meguiar's effectively markets this wax and who doesn't love using something called Gold Class that comes in beautiful packaging?  However, it is not smoke and mirrors.  Inside the bottle is a very good wax that will greatly enhance your paint's finish, while providing all-important protection.For optimum results I strongly encourage you before you apply Gold Class, to clay your car, clean with a paint cleaner (i.e. Deep Crystal Step 1), polish with a pure polish (Deep Crystal Step 2 or #7 Show Car Polish), and then apply this wax. The results are truly remarkable. Again, I have used many waxes to top off my detailing, and Gold Class is one I keep going back to.

If you want to have a \"Wet Look\" paint finish, this can help you achieve that.  This is how I got my 3 year old car looking like a show car.1. Wash you car with Meguiars Car Wash.  Make sure to get all the dirt off.  Dry thoroughly.  I use a super absorbent chamois to speed up the process.  Make sure to do this in the shade.  The car's surface should be cool to the touch.2. Use the Meguiars Claybar. Keep going until your hand glides on top of the paint.  This will give your paint a glass smooth finish.3. Apply Meguiars Paint Cleaner with a Random Orbital Buffer or Meguiars Buffer.  This will remove any stains and very fine swirls.4. Apply this Mirror Glaze with the Random Orbital buffer.  Wipe off and buff using a Microfiber Cloth.5. Apply your choice of Meguiars Waxes with the Orbital buffer.  I personally prefer the Meguiars NXT wax because I dont have to wait long after applying the wax before I can wipe off and buff.6.  Maintain this new finish by using the Mequiars Ultimate Quick Detailer often to clean any dust,tree sap or bird droppings that may land on your car. The Detailer will keep it lookng great and also extend the UV protection.You just need to do this entire process once or twice a year.  Regularly, you just need to wash your car at least once a week.  And you can re-apply Meguiars wax once a month or as often as you like as their waxes do not damage your clear coat.

They're easy to line up, wide enough to provide confidence, and they seem plenty strong. They're light enough to be very easy to lift and move around.These ramps are not hollow shells; they have supports on the inside. Because of this, you cannot place one ramp inside the other for storage.It took a few times for me to get used to driving up these ramps.  Let's face it, driving up an incline in your garage is not something you are probably used to.  The second time I did it, my tires hit the raised lip on the ramp (the one designed to stop the wheels) pretty hard.  When it did this, it made a loud noise, and I suffered a moment of terror before I realized that nothing was wrong.I decided it would be much easier to drive up these ramps if I could see what I was doing.  So, I bought a cheap full-length mirror at Target (the kind designed to be mounted on the inside of a bedroom door).  Now when I use these ramps, I set the mirror down on my garage floor lengthwise, leaning against the wall, adjusted so I can see my front driver-side tire the whole time.  This has made it vastly easier to drive up the ramps with confidence--and without killing my transmission. The same trick also makes backing down the ramps easier. It's important to be going extremely slowly at the point when the tires leave the ramps and make first contact with the floor.

It actually has a 2/4 Drop and 20\" Wheels with 275/45R20 Tires.  I was on my Asphalt Driveway,  I put the Ramps right it front of my front tires, Get into my truck, and drove right up them!!! Didn't slip AT ALL.  There is a Rubber Pad in the middle Front, pretty thick, not large,  but it seemed to work for me.  I used to be a Professional Mechanic 3 months ago, and always had access to Racks.  I Changed Occupations for the better, and so I no longer have Rack access.  So I got a set of these.Again my truck is lowered, and so I was worried about a ramp not fitting under the front of my truck to drive up.  I had no problem with these like I said.  I put them right up Against the tire, and then drove right on up!!!  The Negative is it's not UP very high, at least on my lowered truck.  On my Low to the ground creeper, I could just get under to change the oil and oil filter.  I wanted to change the Fuel filter also, but that was ALMOST impossible.  It's along the frame railing back a bit near the front of the Gas tank,  I could barley get back enough to just reach the filter and 2 wrench it with one hand to get the filter off.  I did manage though.  I wish I could of do it on a rack at my old Job, but my old Boss is P.Oed that I left.  Now he has to work far more and hired a couple Idiots to take my place.  I wouldn't get my car worked on there now!!!I'm not going to knock it down any stars because it didn't lift my truck up enough as I knew how much it would raise it before I ordered them.  Again, No slipping for my truck and it's Rear Wheel Drive!!!  It didn't Sink in the Asphalt, or Crack, or anything else.  Nice and Solid.  The Price was right as $48, with no tax and free 2nd day shipping for me.  It's harder for me to do oil changes these days, having to do it at home, but then again, I've seen some of the work so called Pro Mechanics do on peoples cars/trucks from different places, and I think I'll stick doing most ALL that I can, other then things that just isn't feasible for me to do at home.

I thought this might be the perfect thing to place in my old truck in the event I had a break-down. I also thought it might be good to take on my ATV trips in the event I break down on the trail and need to leave some kind of visible marker on my ATV along the trail.Sad to say, I was rather disappointed. The flare is powered by two AAA batteries and a single red LED. In the daylight, the light output from the flare is barely noticeable. At night-time it is slightly more noticeable and might serve as a marker light on your car to someone who is paying attention. Or, if you were using it on a dark trail, it might be visible from a short distance. But it really is no brighter than the keyfob LEDs that are intended to assist in unlocking a door. The light is also uni-directional (only coming from one side of the flare), so careful positioning would be a must. I think it would be tricky to use as a map light, too, since maps often contain red text which would be difficult to see with a red light.That said, I will not go as far as to claim that the product mis-represents itself. It is re-usable, and it could function as a secondary warning marker. It is not flammable, and it came with batteries which seems rare these days. The idea for the magnetic end that sticks to the sides of vehicles would be good, if most vehicles were made of steel. But many these days are made of fiberglass or aluminum and thus the magnet serves a limited purpose.If this product were marketed as a sort of a secondary marker light, it might be acceptable. One could place it on top of their car or on the trunk as a \"failsafe\". After all, the more lights the better. However, the idea that it would serve as a \"flare\" is just not correct. If I were changing a tire along the side of a busy road, for example, I would have NO faith that anyone would see or notice this light in their headlights.

Not just any plastic, but appears to be manufactured of the kind of hard plastic that quickly turns very brittle and cracks when exposed to the extreme temperature variations found inside a vehicle, which after all, is where this item is meant to be kept. While it is battery powered, and doesn't really pose any kind of roadside fire hazard, its usefulness is severely limited.First of all, one has to rely on always having it loaded with good batteries. Dead batteries do noone any good, and I've found most people just throw items like this in the trunk or glove box, and forget about it, not really thinking to check the batteries regularly.But does it work? Well yes, sort of. The unit has a small lens powered by an LED that either blinks on and off, or lights up continuously. The continuous on is meant for a low-glare map light, while the blinking feature is meant to capture the attention of oncoming motorists. Unfortunately, the LED is not very bright, and is likely to go unnoticed from anyone farther away than 15 to 20 yards, and is so small and low intensity that even if noticed, it is doubtful anyone would recognize it as a hazard or warning beacon. While we certainly don't want anything so bright it blinds oncoming drivers, we also don't want something so dim that it doesn't trigger anyone's warning instincts soon enough.Interstate highway? Forget it, buy some reflective triangles. Rural highways? Not much of a chance of being seen in time at highway speeds. Well lit neighborhoods? It likely won't get noticed. From my perspective, about the only time a unit like this would attract any attention is if it was on a poorly lit rural backroad where the speed limit is 35 mph or under, and there are no other lights in the area to cause any distraction or overpower the weak light source this unit provides.

Depending on how you insert this extension into your vehicle (hole one or two), and how you insert your bike rack or whatever else into the &#34;female&#34; end (hole one or two), there is some adjustment on how much extension you achieve.  In theory.I was hoping to use the SMALLEST amount of extension with this so that I'd achieve about 7&#34; of extension.  I needed to extend my Thule T2 bike rack just enough to clear a larger-than-factory Jeep tire.i am able to use the hole that positions this extension furthest into my Jeep (so the &#34;male&#34; of this extension is adjustable).  Unfortunately, I was not able to utilize the deepest hole in the &#34;female&#34; end of this extension because there is only about 2&#34; of space between that deeper hole and an internal ridge where the inside square bar is welded to the outside square bar.  Hard to describe, but essentially my Thule bike rack it the back of this extension before the holes lined up with the deepest hole in this extension.So.. I suppose you could blame that on my bike rack?  In hind sight though, I wouldn't trust any bike rack that only had that little amount of metal behind the holes--just not enough there to handle the load.  No.. I think that this extension could have been better designed to just have ONE hole on the &#34;female&#34; end, but position it somewhat in-between the two that it currently has.  I doubt that there are many racks out there that could utilize the deepest hole in this extension's &#34;female&#34; side...One additional comment.. I read some reviews that criticized the welds.  I am not a welder, but in my observation, the welds seem smooth and uniform all the way around this.  I must say that the metal is a little thin compared to other extensions that I've seen.  I think it's quite fine for any 2-bike rack out there, and I'm using it for that.  When I set up to carry 4-bikes, I do worry that this may snap though, and I am pursuing another extension for that reason.Conclusion:  If you are only carrying 2 bikes, and you are happy with the extension possibilities IGNORING the deepest hole in the &#34;female&#34; part of this extension, I recommend it.  The price is reasonable and the integrated locking bolt is really nice (especially if you buy their optional locking bolt.)If you want a very short extension, this probably won't work.If you plan to carry 4 bikes, I don't know if this is strong enough.

Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4\" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape. One more thing: The THICKNESS of the screw head doesn't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring. The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips \"X\" to use the screwdriver.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Some mounting screw head diameters are too large to fit the plastic rings.", "unixReviewTime": 1384041600, "reviewTime": "11 10, 2013"}

I reviewed a separate kit that came with the bolts and threaded plastic mounts for your bumper but that did not directly talk about the covers (I think, who can remember?). These covers and the clear plastic rings which allow the caps to be held in place are easy to install with the single exception that the holes in the clear plastic rings are almost always a little larger that the diameter of the bolts holding your plate in place. This creates the small problem of a chance to accidently crush the top of the ring as you re-tighten each bolt because the ring will sit low on the bolt threads causing the outer portion of the ring (which allows the cap to &#34;snap&#34; and be held in place) so that it falls under the back of the bolt head. So you'll need to slip the ring over the bolt head and you get near the end of tightening down the bolt. The only other problem I've had with these caps is that one cap in one set (new) split as I was snapping it onto the clear plastic ring. I had extras form an old set so no big deal.

The lights however shine brightly enough to be seen through the tint even in the day. I've had the same batteries in it for over a year.

The \"Wireless Motion Sensor Detector Alarm With 2 REMOTE\" by MacTop for $14 + $7 shipping is pretty good.

Many of them claimed that the 20W-50 was designed for slow revving Harley-Davidsons with true V-Twins instead of the somewhat higher revving L-Twins from Ducati.I had clutch slippage with Rotella T6 5W-40, so I tried the M1 V-Twin 20W-50 because it is the only over the counter synthetic xW-50 JASO MA-compliant oil I can find outside the realm of boutique Motorcycle-specific oils from Motul or Silkolene at nearly double the price.The V-Twin 20W-50 is fairly thick out of the bottle, and my 696's engine starts up with a slow lumbering attitude and sound. I contacted Mobil to make sure they would recommend it, and they stated that the V-Twin 20W-50 was the correct oil to use in my 696. Once on the road, I didn't hear/feel anything wrong. WOT 9000 RPM upshifts were clean and precise. The datalogs I got from my Ducati Data Acquisition did not show any RPM spikes, and I did not hear the cat-like screeches after an upshift.As for the high-revving engine comment earlier, I looked up Buell's 1125 and Aprilia's RSV4 engine oil requirements. They both called for 15W-50, and Amsoil's catalog showed recommendations for 20W-50. The 1125 and RSV4 are by no means low revving engines, they can rev higher than most of Ducati's engines which are already fairly high at 9k-11k RPM.Overall: 5/5 stars, great oil to use if your bike needs 15W-50.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great oil to use for a bike that needs 15W-50", "unixReviewTime": 1332547200, "reviewTime": "03 24, 2012"}

I have never used Slime in an automobile tire, but since the materials are basically the same, I would assume that the product would work in a similar way.For an automobile, where the flat occurs makes a big difference.  If your car is parked and notice your tire is flat, this kit would probably be quite useful.  You can at least use the compressor to pump up the tire and check how bad the leak is.  If it is a fast leak, you can try using the Slime and see if it takes care of the problem.  The car does not need to be jacked up to use the product.If the puncture happens when the car is being driven, the problem is more serious.  When you drive on tire that is significantly deflated or flat, most times you will do heavy duty damage, or tear the tire.  If that happens, Slime won't help.  The tire will need to be replaced.  The instructions state that Slime will not work on punctures greater than 1/4 inch.  So basically, Slime is intended to address only minor tire damage.The Smart Spair kit is a pretty good deal.  It consists of a 16 ounce bottle of slime, and a compressor which plugs into the lighter outlet.  According to the label, a 16 ounce bottle, should be adequate to treat one averaged sized tire.  The 16 ounce bottle is available at Amazon for about nine dollars.  Subtract this cost from the price of the kit, and you are getting the compressor for less than fifteen dollars, which is not a bad deal.  The compressor has a pressure valve, ten foot cord, and on/off switch.  It is pretty noisy, and seems to have a reasonably quick pump rate.  It is rated for use on a minimum 15 amp circuit.  Some older cars have lighter circuits rated at only 8 amps, so you may want to check this before you buy.Hopefully I will not have to use the Smart Spair.  Based on the good (though limited) experience I have with Slime, I thought it would be good to have around, just in case.  There are many situations, where changing a tire at the side of the road, can be hazardous.  A kit like this could be valuable to those that are not capable of, jacking up their vehicle and changing the tire.

I have used this Turtle Wax product on our 2 year old Black Nissan Altima. I love the shiny jet black color, but it is a very unforgiving paint color, as every single chip, scratch, swirl, defect will show, not to mention water spots right after rinsing the car, prior to drying it off. The only thing that I can do is to take it to the car wash and let them wash it so that there are no spots. Our water is just too hard to wash it at home unless you have a white car or silver. Take it home after the wash and clay bar the sucker (Meguiars makes the best clay bar kit). Then you can use their ultimate compound to make it even smoother or visa-versa. If you do use the Ultimate compound be prepared that it will remove any old wax or dye that may be hiding the small scratches. Then you can use a nice car wax. Meguiars NXT 2.0 is good (no I don't work for Meguiars, they just make excellent products). This Turtle wax product does hide a few small scratches and the chip stick works pretty good. The shine is not fantastic, but it is pretty good, and it is inexpensive. I am going to try a black crayon next, instead of the chip stick, just to see if it works as well. I bet it will.

Lucas Upper Cylinder is the \"Lube\" only, even though it says cleaner it is not.  The \"cleaner\" is a product they use in oil that cleans, but not in the sense as you know what a cleaner is.

I actually do feel a difference sometimes in various vehicles, and also I have not felt a difference in others.

Do not be afraid to complete a few extra passes with it. This is actually step 3 out of 4 steps. The first is to wash your car, then polish it, then clay bar the car, then use Megiuars Tech 2.0 polymer sealer. The clay bar step is actually effortless. You just have to remember not to drop the clay, and do extra passes/wipes, a small section (12&#34; x 12&#34;) at a time. The last few passes with the clay bar you can use the weight of the clay itself. One reviewer wrote that this was too mild and it did not remove a lot of contaminants. This is because he may be missing the &#34;polishing step&#34;. The &#34;contaminants&#34; should come off with the washing and polishing. The clay bar is for removing fine contaminants. Your paint will be very smooth and silky. That is no joke either; it really feels smooth. The car will then be ready for a polymer-sealant or a wax if you prefer.In Summary: Step 1 Wash your car with Megiuars Gold Class (better than the stinky yellow hazy Meguiars Ultimate Wash). Step 2 - Polish it with either of the following depending on the contaminants. Feel the paint. Is there a lot of grittiness ? Then you may want to use Megiuars medium/fine cut cleaner. The medium cut cleaner will remove some heavy duty water spots that you just cannot get out with anything else. If you do use the &#34;medium cut cleaner&#34;, then you may want to use a &#34;swirl remover&#34; after this step. If your paint feels all right (a small amount of grittiness), then a normal &#34;polish&#34; (Megiuars Ultimate Compound is great) will work just fine. Helpful hint. Purchase an inexpensive sponge, not a real loop sponge, one of those large smooth cheapy sponges for $1.75. If you use a round hand applicator, you may obtain a zebra stripe pattern. The zebra pattern means that the product is working, but your fingers are smashing down more than the applicator portion in between your fingers. You need an even pressure and your large cheapy sponge will achieve that. I also tried a large circular sponge applicator for my drill and that actually worked very well and it saved my arm a bit too. The circular applicator for my drill achieved the best results. I had major hard water spot damage that I just could not get out. Always remember that even though the paint appears very good after this step has been completed, do not stop at this step. There is no protection and your paint needs it since you just removed the protection. Step 3 - Clay Bar your car - use this kit or &#34;Mothers&#34;, although since I am writing a review in Megiuars product, use it. It works very well. Follow the directions. Use medium to light pressure. The last pass can be the weight of your clay and hand. I usually use 10-12 passes. Do not be afraid to make extra passes. The clay is really non-abrasive, and almost effortless to use. Complete the entire car. Do not drop the clay. If you do drop it there may be some grit hiding in the clay and you will scratch the heck out of your paint. I have used it after I dropped it, but it is a hassle removing the top layer of the clay that dropped. Step 4 - Waxing time - There are many many decisions to be made on this step. The different types of wax and sealants, paste wax, liquid wax will confuse even the most experienced car enthusiast. Do you enjoy waxing your vehicle every other week or once a month ? Then a very good quality Carnuba wax will work for you. Do you want the shine to last for 90 days or so ? The poly-sealant is right for you. Do you want to use a &#34;paste wax&#34; and enjoy a good workout for your biceps and triceps? Then a good paste wax is good for you. For me I want the shine to last for 90 days with minimal amount of effort to apply and remove. This is why I use Megiuars Tech 2.0 Wax which is technically not a wax at all, it is a synthetic polymer that shines very well. It will also last about 3 times longer than the carnuba wax and it is very easy to apply and remove. If you absolutely hate waxing your car and you do not mind the wonderful chemical smell, the once a year Nu Finish is actually a very good deal. It may not last a full year, but i tell you what, it is really close to it. I have used it and it works very well. It is also about $7 - $8 a can. Be sure to seal it up after you use it though, as it will age if you do not seal it up. But boy does it stink !!!

I've been washing and waxing my cars for 20 years, usually using a 3-step system (cleaner, polish, wax), and I usually get pretty decent results.  But I've heard so much about claying, I had to give it a try, and I'm glad I did.On my 2006 Honda Pilot with 100K+ miles, I washed and clayed first and was amazed at how much smoother the paint was.  I then tested a panel with Meguairs' Ultimate Cleaning Compound, and it did make an improvement, so I \"cleaned\" the car, then polished (Ultimate Polish) and waxed (Ultimate Wax), using an orbital polisher.  It took a few hours, but the results are astounding.  The paint is literally (not figuratively) smooth as glass.  I don't think it even felt like this when it was brand new.  The mirror finish is incredible.So if you've never clayed your car before, don't hesitate.  Just be sure to use lots of the included Quick Detailer for lubricant.I found the Meguiar's kit to be very good.  I broke off about 1/3 of the clay bar and that got me through half the car, then I used another 1/3 for the rest (including the windows).  So assuming that was the proper amount, I should be able to do 3 cars with the 2 bars in this kit.

It seems strange and like a lot of work for you car, but both impressions were incorrect.After washing your vehicle with a safe wash, Claying your vehicle is the next step and a vital step.  Claying removes above surface contaminants on your paint's surface: bits of overspray, tar, etc. and lots of other things you can or more likely can't even see.  After washing your car, rub your flat hand across the surface. It won't smooth as glass. Furthermore, listen!  You'll hear your hand going back and forth over the surface as it rubs against the contaminants.  This is a car that needs to be clayed and just about any car if it has never been clayed needs to be clayed.  Even a brand new car on the lot often has contaminants.  Furthermore, once clayed, it's usually recommend to do it again every 3 months to a year, depending on the environment your car is in.  Honestly, claying your vehicle doesn't take a particularly long amount of time.  I'd say it's possible to do it in just under thirty minutes.The Smooth Surface Clay Kit from the wonderful folks at Meguiar's is the perfect kit to clay your vehicle.  Again, after washing your vehicle, spray an area with the Quick Detailer, and then use the clay bar across the surface.  You can search Youtube for Meguiar's Clay kit, to see demonstrations from users, but it isn't hard to do. Do a thorough job on your vehicle, and the way your hand then moves across the surface will impress you.  I'm amazed every time.After claying, you have several options.  The clay kit includes a sample of cleaner wax, and you can certainly use that. It has some mild cleaners and some protection.  However, if you use a cleaner wax, I'd recommend waxing the car more often as it isn't quite as durable as dedicated separate products.  Once a month for example with the cleaner wax, would be good.  Or, you could use the cleaner wax for its mild below surface cleaning properties followed by a more robust wax product such as Meguiar's Gold Class or NXT 2.0, and then you could potentially be set for a few months.If you want to do even more after claying, you can use a paint cleaner from Meguiar's for below surface contaminants right after claying, and then optionally a Pure Polish after that.  You'd top all that off with a wax such as Meguiar's Gold Class, or Meguiar's NXT 2.0.Furthermore, pick up more of the Quick Detailer, and you can use it to remove light dust and contaminants to your paint on a regular basis, and you can actually find you won't have to wash your vehicle as often.Whatever you choose, regular maintenance of your car's finish will keep you smiling for years to come. Meguiar's clay kit is a great way to start because not only does it make your finish smooth as glass, but it allows whatever wax you apply to adhere more evenly and properly to the surface, providing a better shine and longer lasting protection.A great product.

This was purchased for a 2012 Wrangler Unlimited. The stock horn is fairly weak and usually doesn't produce a reaction from anyone who has cut me off or drives 15 mph while chatting on their phones.The install was rather tight. I didn't remove the front grill and just worked from the top down, right above the driver-side headlight. I mounted one right to the bracket where the stock horn was, and the other was mounted in a nearby hole where a hood alarm sensor would be located. Since I don't have a remote start kit, the sensor was absent.I highly recommend that you have some type of magnetic tool to pick up dropped bolts. Unless you remove the grill, you will be dropping things. Also, the kit comes with nothing more than the two horns and 2 ground wires. I had to purchase the mounting bolts/nuts and decided that, rather than splice into the factory wiring, to make a couple of harnesses (see image). I used male blade connectors on one end of (2) 10\", 18 gauge wires, then used splice connectors to attach another 6\" wire to each of these leads. On all of the (4) remaining wire ends, I placed female blade connectors. It turned the wiring job into a simple plug-n-play operation, while utilizing the factory hot and ground.The horns are definitely louder and the dual horn tone cuts through like a champ. It does startle people all around me when I lay on it. That was the idea, so I'm really happy with it. Supposedly, they upgraded 2013 models to a dual horn. Some report that it's still weaker than this PIAA upgrade.

It covered the car with a nice sudsy coating (not SUPER sudsy, but more than a budget car wash liquid) and smelled like bubble gum!  However, the suds disappeared quickly, almost TOO quickly.  Made me a bit worried.  But I moved on to the hand wash.Poured some in a bucket, filled it up with water, and as expected, LOTS of suds, but they seemed to die down very quickly... After the rinsing off the soap and drying the car though, this is where the car wash liquid REALLY shines (bad puns are bad).In the sun, the paint was deep, reflective, and it just looked CONSIDERABLY cleaner than before.  It looked like a whole new depth was added to the paint.  Coming fromMeguiar's Wash and Wax - 48 oz., this car wash liquid takes the cake in final finish and cleaning ability.  However, I think the Meguiar's takes the trophy home for best smelling (to me), most suds, and longest lasting suds.  The Mothers left an awesome finish and kept water spots away when drying, but the bubblegum smell was nearly non-existent and the suds were worrying at first.I would consider Mothers California Gold as a nice start to a full-on DIY detailing job (or even just a quick, light detailing job).  It gives a nice base to work off of.  It seems to clean dirt off more effectively than Meguiar's (tested by clay bar) and leaves a nice, smooth finish, giving you a bit more peace-of-mind.However, if you are short on time and would rather just give it a quick wash, consider the Meguiar's.  It'll give you a one-two combo of a wash that's ever so slightly less shiny and will coat it with a (very) light wax.Sum:- Good: Smells like bubble gum, leaves a deep finish (whole new depth - especially on darker colors!), keeps water spots from forming while drying, cleaning ability is awesome!- Not-So-Good: Suds are a bit disappointing, scent isn't as defined or noticeable once rinsed off.Recommended!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A Bit Deceiving...

For that, I use Mothers Mag & Aluminum Polish.  It works great, and it leaves my aluminum wheels looking shiny and like new.I normally use one of my husband's old (white) athletic socks to apply it - by wearing it on my hand like a sock puppet.  The instructions say to use the polish sparingly, so I just put a dab on the sock and rub it around.  It removes any remaining road grime, brake dust - and water stains, which are sometimes the hardest to clean - fully restoring the finish to its previous luster.  The old sock \"hand puppet\" allows me to reach into every nook and cranny.  I then use a cheap microfiber wiping cloth to finish the job and remove the polish.I couldn't be happier with the results.  This isn't something I use every time I wash my car or my wheels.  But when I need it - nothing else works quite as well. I highly recommend Mother's Mag & Aluminum Polish.  This jar will probably last you a really long time.  Enjoy.p.s.

{"reviewerID": "A38D1RKG2YKC8E", "asin": "B00068XCQU", "reviewerName": "Arthur Senior \"Small Engine Mechanic\"", "helpful": [5, 6], "reviewText": "EXPERIENCE: I have found this charger to be pretty cool! First of all, it was packaged well from Amazon.com, they like to use the air pocket material for packing, which works great, and is less messy then foam peanuts. The charger comes inside a plastic packaging case with both alligator and permanent wiring connectors. It also comes with a warrantee slip and a paper manual. The first thing I noticed was how light weight the charger is, right around 3-LBS, as opposed to my heavy 8-LBS fast charger counterpart.I really like the cables the charger comes with, the alligator clip ends are made of actual copper, which as you know, allow for better conductivity, which is why copper is used on computer heat sinks to dissipate heat. This particular wire also includes an 7.5-AMP inline fuse, with a cover over it to keep water out. At the other end of the wire uses a proprietary connector system, so that you can disconnect it from the charger incase of emergency, without the need to unplug the charger!The permanent style wire, uses your typical battery bolt type connectors, which allow you to permanently install the charger, for year round use. This also uses a 7.5-AMP inline fuse, and also uses the proprietary connector at the other end. All I had to do to hook it up was, connect the alligators to the battery, connect the other end to the charger output wire, and then plug in the power, that simple!The first thing I saw was a steady \"RED\" light, to indicate that the charger was charging the battery. However, since my battery was at 12-volts at the get go, it didn't take long for the charger to start flashing the \"GREEN\" light, which indicates battery at 80% charged. Remember, a fully charged battery will actually show 13.5 to 14.5 volts. So, it took a while, charging at a 1.2-AMP interval, to get my battery there.TIP: With a lot of modern day vehicles, they have onboard systems which have a low power draw off the battery at all times while the vehicle is sitting. This is unfortunate, as the charger only charges at a 1.2-AMP interval, any onboard systems sucking that amount, will keep the charger from charging your battery. In this particular case, it is best to disconnect your battery from your vehicle.Once my battery was charged, it went into float mode. You know when its in float mode, when the \"RED\" light goes off and the \"GREEN\" light stays on steady. At this point of time, it is not putting a charge on my battery. But it will wait till it drops due to the freezing temperature, and then it will kick back on till its charged again. Think of it like the furnace in your home, the heater comes on when the temperature falls, and turns off when the temperature reaches your set temp setting.CONCLUSION: My fast charger would always be very warm when I used it, but the BTPLUS is only luke warm, you hardly even notice it! My fast charger also emitted a noticeable loud humming sound, my BTPLUS emits a sound so quiet, that you have to put your ear up to the charger to hear it! My fast charger has the ability to cook a battery and destroy it, where as the BTPLUS will maintain my battery and make it last a long time. Sometimes people think that speed is everything, I say no, cause when it comes to batteries, slower is better. The way I look at it is, this is an awesome charger, and I recommend it with 5-stars!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Battery Tender Plus 12V Charger - A Batteries Thirst For Power", "unixReviewTime": 1289001600, "reviewTime": "11 6, 2010"}

I use these on many vehicles and usually buy the cheap harbor freight ones . However I spent up for this for my prize motorcycle . I have it plugged into a battery backup for tv equipment . It stopped working and has a burning smell into it . Customer Service said they would replace it if I sent it in . It is 7 months old but was only put in service for the past week as I had so many others . Thbey scared me saying they often find user error . What could I have done ? I couldn't treat it better . Because it is under a year they said to send in in at my expense and the turnaround is 7- 10 days if they don't determine user error . That's scarey .I still find trusting people is best and I will take the time and expense to send it in though many companies just replace things . I can see why they do not this isn't a cheap piece of equipment . I was very happy for the 7 months ( week it worked ) and I love their quick disconnect plug , sadly I may have lost my battery as it could of broke anytime since it was put in service . I know it was working when first hooked up  . Because I value my equipment so much I am going trust this was a fluke and  buy a extra one to have as I am disabled and these save batteries on vehicles that rarely are driven . I am a little disappointed I had a failure so quick again it was in the first week of use after I stored my purchase since Jan 2013  . Failures was the reason I stopped using the Harbor Freight $6 on sale ones but their so cheap I keep a half a dozen at the house and with any hint of a problem put a new one on . I use these devices on several items and would have to replace about 2 harbor freight ones each year .  Also  with theirs you do not have that nice disconnect that is so great on snowmobiles , mopeds , or motorcycles . I would even like to have one on the cars and may as they can fit the accessory connectors  .  I did expect this to be much more trustworthy but will give it one more chance before I give up . Though at up to $69 retail that's a lot of money to loose for burning up a few penny capacitor if Lorreta at Deltran is correct . She said they will go poof if their is any fluctuation in voltage . Nothing else on that circuit or any others had issues at all . It was just placed in service . I will update after sending in . They did not require it verbally when calling in but I will pay the extra money to have it signed for . It helps since it is the first year not to have to pay the $8 inspection fee . You can smell it is burnt . Frustrating , I hate electronic devices because they do often have such high failure rates .Note : it took three weeks and I had to be home to sign for the one sent back which caused me to spend a whole day watching for Fedx but they replaced the bad unit . I had a surge suppressor on the other one and have since upgraded it to another Monster unit that was a daily deal . I also have gone with a 14 kw Kohler generator with a whole whose surge protector . The electric grid here is going down several times a year and it doesn't look like that is going to turn around anytime soon .

They're great devices; I've brought batteries seemingly back from the dead with them when some other chargers I had could not.  However, there are two points worth making:The Junior and Plus have the same logic; they only differ in the maximum charging current.  Basically, the Plus will charge a battery up faster.  If you're only using them for storage or you're not in a hurry, save nearly $20 and get the Junior.  But I expect that you'll be happy with either one.The one complaint I have is with the Warranty.  My Plus stopped working recently.  I'm not sure why; perhaps a power surge or something; it's not like I've ever dropped or abused it.  In any event, since they have a 10 year warranty, I called Deltran up.  I can send the unit in (which will cost me $8+ for shipping with some kind of tracking so I can verify that it arrived) and then they charge $17 and change for a \"warranty diagnosic\" and return shipping.  So, it basically costs around $25 to get my $40 device serviced under warranty.  It's not a completely unreasonable sum, but if Deltran really had faith in their products, they could easily eat that cost - I think I should at least not have to pay for a diagnostic fee on something under warranty which I've already proven to not work in multiple outlets and on multiple batteries. I think I'll just pay the extra $15 to get a brand new one, and use this as a paper weight.But anyway, the products work really well.

I think I found the source of the problem after I ordered it but this thing will make sure my battery is kept at full charge.  It comes with 0-ring terminals and alligator clips.  The alligator clips are very easy to put on the terminals.  I read somewhere that the 0-rings are for motorcycles and lawn mowers and stuff so I will just keep them for that.  Anyways, I used regular jumper cables to give my battery enough juice to start my car.  No where in the instructions does it say if the vehicle should be on or off while charging.  My best guess was off since it takes almost 2 days for a complete charge and who leaves their car on for that long, and plus you can charge it with the battery out of the car.  So anyways, I made that little charge for my battery to get up and running and disconnected the jumper cables.  This next part is very important.  First you should connect the alligator cables to the quick connect ends on the battery charger.  Then put the alligator clips on the car positive/negetive leads.  Then if you used an extension cord like I did, plug that into a socket.  Now line up the charger end with the extension cord end.  Make sure all your connections are well on, and then connect the extension cord to the battery charger.  If all goes well, like it did with mine, the red light should come on and say Charging.  I read somewhere that if both the green/red lights STAY on, that your battery is completely dead and that you should disconnect the battery right away or it could lead to bad damage.  The red/green lights flash at startup but then it turned to red.  So anyways, now I am waiting for the complete charge to fill up my battery.  It is 3pm now on a Thursday and I will fill in this space with when it completed.  Keep in mind the instructions say to keep this charger as far away from the battery as possible while charging.  I have mine on the ground right in front of the car so that should work just fine.  I wouldn't recommend putting it inside the engine anywhere like the instructions say.  All in all, for the money of this thing, it is definately worth having around.  I wish I knew about this when I had my motorcycle, because that thing died on me every other day and the quick connect on this would have made charging that thing a breeze.  Also with a riding mower that won't start.  I might get a socket end for the cord so it can charge while in the car.  Other people have said this in their reviews and I will see what it's all about.  Good luck charging!Edit:  So the cigarette adapter just makes hooking it up easier, but it still needs to be connected to a DC outlet so I will pass on that.  Also, I found out that the unit gets very very hot.  I had it on for like 4 hours and touched it and it almost burned me.  Being close to 90 degrees outside couldn't have helped much either, but just be careful.Edit:  So my battery is fully charged now.  It took about a day to charge the whole thing.

I purchased this before last winter, and never once had an issue with the battery being too low or too cold, despite some pretty frigid temps. I set this on a shelf just in front of and above my truck, and leave the lead to the charger hanging. I then wired the battery end to my battery and channeled it so the plug end can be pulled through the grill. It's nearly invisible when it's not in use, but is very quick and easy to plug up. I've gotten used to just plugging up the truck every time I'm done with it, and this little puppy brings it up to full charge fairly quickly!Highly recommended, especially if you have an older car that either doesn't get driven much or is a heavy drain on the battery.**********************************************************************************Update 01/02/11:Unfortunately, I sold my '67 truck back in the late summer of 2010. However, this little battery tender was still going strong, so I immediately hooked it up to my 4-wheeler. It has been doing a great job keeping the battery on it charged up through some especially cold weather we've had. So after @3years of use, I still give it 5-stars. Awesome product!Update 11/19/12: I noticed something really smelling in my garage, and spent quite a while trying to find it. It was a horrible \"ozone\" like smell, but clearly was the smell of burning electronics. When I got to my Battery Tender, I noticed the light was no longer on and it smelled really bad, so I immediately unplugged it. I'm not quite sure what happened, but am a little concerned about this. That said, I will consider replacing it as I still believe it's a good product.Update 02/19/13: As these units carry a 10-year limited warranty (if you have your receipt), I decided to send it in. The cost of mailing it was around $9 for standard post, and $11 for Priority Mail. The warranty replacement charge is $12.95 (why not just $13?). So in total, it will cost me just under $25. That is, assuming they replace it, which I certainly hope they will! I will post follow-up later.Update 03/20/13: It took approximately 2 weeks, but Deltran DID replace my charger under warranty. The thing is, the replacement charger - which appears to be brand new, and not refurbished - did not come with ANY paperwork. No \"we're sorry for your inconvenience\" letter, no receipt, no packing slip... nothing. So my warranty on the replacement will only be as good as the remainder of what I had left on my original 10 years (approx 4 years). The inconvenience of the return was frustrating, and I'd have liked at least an acknowledgement of that from Deltran, but it \"is what it is\". Hopefully this new one holds up at least as long as the first.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent little battery charger!", "unixReviewTime": 1215561600, "reviewTime": "07 9, 2008"}

I remove the battery from my vehicle because I didn't have any outlets near the car and I didn't want to run an extension cord because I am sure someone would trip on it or unplug it.This unit came with 2 cords to attach to the battery (via alligator clips or ring terminals). I ended up using the alligator clips and everything worked out just fine.I then plugged the unit into the wall and the red light came on which means that the battery needed to be charged. It's been on for about an hour now, but that's ok with me because I purchased this thing to maintain the battery, not to rapidly charge it.I do like the fact that the manufacturer offers a 10 year warranty for this item, however it clearly states in the manual that you need to send $15.95 with the unit for evaluation, shipping & handling. Then the warranty card states that if any repairs need to be made, the company will notify you of the cost. Sounds like some sort of a screwy scam to me, but if this unit ever fails (hopefully in many years to come) I will simply purchase another one because I am sure it would cost you about $5-10 to ship the unit back to the manufacturer, then you need to include your $16 fee and then pay for any repairs. The darn thing only costs $40...why would you pay and waste your time trying to collect on the warranty?All in all, I like this thing and as long as it works for many years I will be happy.***UPDATE 2/18***I ended up putting the battery back in the car and running a HD extension cord.I've checked the battery every few days with a volt meter and it is holding constant at about 13.27 volts.Still happy with my purchase.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great product!", "unixReviewTime": 1294185600, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2011"}

My station is slightly elevated over the road height so one person had to hold the hose up so everything could flow downhill and another person had to operate the dump valves and water at the station.  No longer!  Set the hose in the craddle...pull the valve...hold the flush water valve.  That's it!!!  Now this was designed for full service parks that have sewer hook-ups right next to the rig, but it will work equally well for both.  The carry handle acts as a retainer, and like all good RV productions it folds nicley into a compact and light package that stores easly most anywhere.  The price is good here on Amazon, beating out all retailers I've found with the savings on shipping.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One person job at last!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1278547200, "reviewTime": "07 8, 2010"}

I found it restricted flow to much . My fault for buying it for a non recommended application . I have very hard water and a spigot that is unfiltered from my well . Put this on it and use that to hand water my plants . Works ok for that as the lower flow is no big deal when filling up the plant watering jug . Gave it a four and thought about a 3 because of how much it slowed down flow . Every time it is utilized it takes a while to get consistent flow and it is at about 1/2 the normal rate out of my well which is in the specs required for flow and pressure . it is my  belief this could be a issue  in the proper application also . Make a note that a $9 pressure regulator is suggested when RVing and not knowing the pressure of the systems one is connecting too . You will know if you needed one your hose will  burst . Good hoses are not cheap either and all us older individuals know it is worth having a good one that bends and coils easily  in any  weather .Note flow improved with use rather quickly .

Why spend a lot when this filter does what you need.I have used these filters for about 12 years and they are the best for the money. They really last a few months of constant use.I mounted this water filter in line inside trailer where I was able to cut main line in and added hose fittings to accomadate the filter ( most water lines in are a hose material untill they tie into pex tubing so this was easy to do with basic hose fittings ((if its easy to get to as mine is)).Doing it this way I dont need to mess with the filter everytime I setup and breakdown anymore outside trailer.I also add a 2nd one on the cold water side of the main kitchen sink. Pex tubing is what the trailer has as water piping as do most RV these days. I added filter to the pex piping using pex hose fitting as well to accomadate the filter. They sell the filters in 2 packs for about 24.00 so for me its way less exspensive installing these 2 great filters and not worrying about clean water all summer.

If you are looking to purchase this product under the same pretense, let me save you the time -- in my case, the better part of an afternoon.First, a quick explanation of how the valve works -- there are actually three components at play: 1) the large diameter plug that screws into the water heater, 2) a secondary plug that screws into the first, and 3) the actual valve which you open and close to drain the water.  I believe the intent of this design is to allow &#34;regular&#34; draining of the water heater with the last/smallest valve, while removal of the medium nut could be used perhaps at the end of the season to allow more sediment and debris to exit the tank quickly (due to the larger diameter).  Sidenote: opening the actual valve (the smallest component) drains the tank very, very slowly, and sometimes only at a trickle if you can't get air behind the water -- in my case, I had to open the pressure relief valve (in addition to all faucets) to produce an acceptable drain rate.While the valve piece never had any issues with leaking, the other components did.  I tried screwing in these nuts with and without Teflon tape, and at various depths.  No matter what the combination, there was always a small leak coming from either of these pieces.  There appeared to be no way to practically stop the leaking.  I also tried wrapping the nuts with an excess of Teflon tape (5+ wraps), to no avail.I gave up after about 2-3 hours of tinkering, returned the valve to Amazon, and ended up sticking with the standard nylon plug.

Like most strong epoxy's, you have to combined the two for the product to work. They recommend you use a clean disposable container, I used a sour cream container which I washed first.The first thing you are going to want to do before you make a JB Weld mix, is to prep the surface before application. They recommend you use Acetone or paint thinner to clean the surface, as it will not leave a petroleum film, since I didn't have any of either, I used carburetor/choke cleaner.Since the surface's were already rough, I didn't have to rough them up. However, keep in mind, if you are planning to apply JB Weld to a smooth surface, you should also rough up the surface using a fine grit sand paper as a second preparation step. I began applying JB Weld, with my cheap $1.00 painters brush from the dollar store. I applied the thick compound evenly over the entire area which meshed with the rim.Then using a piece of wood on one side of the rim, and a C-clamp, I clamped the piece on the rim with pressure and left it there for over 24-hours. After 24-hours, the JB Weld was cured and I removed the C-clamp to reveal a very strong bond! I tried to move the piece back and fourth, but it wouldn't budge, its welded like it should be!The nice thing about JB Weld, is that it can be sanded, ground down, painted, after it has been cured. I noticed JB Weld had blooped out the edges after I installed the piece. So using a dremel with a deburring tool, I managed to grind it down flush with the rim.I also used this product to seal a gas leak in the tillers carburetor bowl. It actually did as advertised and sealed the leak, there is no gas leaking out of the carb now!CONCLUSION: While I would not have believed this product could actually weld metal together, I am now a believer. If you don't own a welders kit, or have any welding knowledge, JB Weld, in my opinion, is the best product to get you out of a jam.

Most epoxies dry with little running or shrinkage, and so are good for filling gaps.  The major drawback to epoxies is that they consist of two parts (resin and hardener) which must be mixed in small batches, and then applied with your own applicator (e.g., a toothpick or popsicle stick). Some are packaged in a dual-syringe--but that is not an adequate solution, because the components must still be manually mixed in order harden to maximum strength.WHEN TO USE JB-WELDJB-Weld is a very strong epoxy cement.  JB-Weld is the cement/glue of choice when joining metal parts or filling holes in metals.  Otherwise, ordinary epoxy cement or other types of cements/glues are usually better choices.  Some other reviewers have complained that the descriptive name \"weld\" is inappropriate---to some extent that's true.  JB Weld can do some jobs welding can't.  Conversely some simple welding jobs like joining two thin metal rods at right angles are difficult with JB Weld.HOW TO USE JB-WELDGeneral Principles: Although JB WELD makes an excellent filler---and can even be used to cast small parts, it is not remotely as strong as real metal used this way.  Whenever possible, use JB WELD as an adhesive---a very thin layer of JB WELD holding two pieces of metal together.  Always reinforce with metal pieces when possible.  For example, rather than building up a massive flange with JB Weld, you might be able to use scrap peice of metal to form most of the flange, held in place with JB Weld.  The greater the relative surface area of contact, the strong the bond will be.Surface Preparation:  As with any adhesive, the surface must be clean and rough.  Clean with a solvent (according to another reviewer, acetone is the best solvent for this purpose, but rubbing alcohol will work), roughen the surface, then clean with the solvent again.  Use a clean cloth for each application of solvent.  I generally use a small grinding wheel in a Dremel tool to roughen the surfaces.  You can also scratch the surface with a knife, or use coarse sandpaper, or both depending on the material.The solvent cleaning is for removing the LAST TRACES of oil from CLEAN surfaces.  If the parts are oily, even multiple cleanings with solvent may not be enough---you may redeposit oil from your cleaning cloth or as the solvent evaporates on the surface.  So, if you can detect any oil on any portion of the part, or if you have any doubt, clean it with a degreaser first.  If you do not have a commercial degreaser handy, a paste of laundry detergent and a stiff brush may do the trick.  Only when you are certain that there are no traces of oil is it time for the solvent cleaning(s).Joining Broken Parts: If you are joining broken parts, with a clean but irregular matching surfaces, limit the roughening to scratching with a wire brush or etching with an acid (but be sure to wash off all traces of the acid). Apply a THIN uniform layer of JB WELD, lightly clamp together hard enough to squeeze out any excess. Sometimes a thick rubber band is perfect. Often you can arrange pieces so that the weight of the top piece will hold the joint together until the JB Weld cures. Sometimes you can place a weight (such as a brick) on top to apply gentle pressure.  Do not remove the clamp or pressure until the JB Weld has cured completely.  After an hour or two, after the glue has set but is still soft, you can cut off any excess with a knife or razor---but if you don't need to cut the excess off, don't.  Often you can build-up the surfaces around a break for added strength.  Sometimes blue painters tape can be used to help hold pieces together while the glue sets, and/or to make a temporary stand to hold the pieces in the best orientation.ScotchBlue Painter's Tape for Multi-Surfaces 2090-.75A, 3/4 Inches by 60 Yards, 1 RollJoining Dissimilar Parts:  Minimize any gaps if possible, e.g., by sanding if possible so that the contact as perfect as possible.  If you will be filling substantial gaps, sometimes it is helpful to cover openings with blue painters tape to prevent the JB Weld from flowing away and leaving gaps.Joining Long Thin Parts (rods or sheets): Try to overlap if possible, or reinforce them with a similar overlapping peice of metal glued in place with JB Weld.  To join a 1/8\" steel rod, to another 1/8\" steel rod, forming a \"T\" (a common and easy welding job, almost impossible with just JB-Weld), cut two 1\"-long \"L's\" from a heavy-paper clip, (or make L's from similar wire), and embed those with JB-Weld on opposite sides of the joint.  You can further strenthen the joint by wrapping fine steel wire around the rods holding the \"L\"s in place---before  covering it all with JB-Weld.  Be sure to thoroughly clean the rods and wires first (see below).  For small parts, or when wire wouldn't work well, unwaxed dental floss is remarkably strong, and can do an excellent job of reinforcing joints (when embeded in JB Weld). Ideally, apply the JB Weld, then wind the floss tightly into the soft JB Weld.Filling Holes:  Don't forget to prepare the surfaces as described above---even if you can only roughen the surfaces with an ice pick or awl.  JB Weld shrinks very little as it cures so fill the hole completely.  If it is possible to sand the surface when the JB Weld has hardened, then overfill the hole slightly.  Since JB Weld flows a little until it sets, the surface should be horizontal.  If not horizontal, you can apply the JB Weld and then cover the hole with blue painters tape until the JB Weld sets.  Depending on the job, it is often a better strategy to fill the gap as much as possible with a piece (or pieces) of metal embedded in JB Weld that a single mass of pure JB Weld.Reinforcing a leaking pipe:  Work JB Weld into a piece of fiberglass cloth or with a spatula, apply, and then add more JB Weld to any thin spots and to feather out the edges. You may have to apply several layers of the JB Weld-saturated fiberglass cloth. Sometimes wire cloth (window screening) can be used.Holes in car body panels etc:  If you can cover at least one side of the hole with a piece of sheet metal (held in place by JB Weld) that is a good strategy---the combination of pop-rivets and JB Weld often works especially well, even if you ultimately sand the heads of the pop rivets away.TEKTON 6555 Rivet Gun with 40-pc. RivetsMixing:  Follow the instructions.  A paper plate can be a good mixing surface; popsicle sticks are the best mixing tools.  Beware that you must use the same amount of resin and hardener, and they MUST be VERY thoroughly mixed.  Mix until you are certain that it is completely and thoroughly mixed, and then continue mixing for twice that time.  Seriously!!!Curing:  Follow the instructions, but wait longer than recommended: the longer you wait the stronger the bond.  A a day or two at 70 or 80 degrees is a reasonable MINIMUM.  Note that epoxies do not \"dry\"--there are no solvents to evaporate, instead a chemical reaction hardens the cement (a plastic resin).  Chemical reactions are proportional to temperature (the rule of thumb is that for each 10 degrees, the reaction speed doubles).  Using the rule of thumb, if it takes 1 day to cure at 80 degrees, then it takes 16 days to cure at 40 degrees, and that's only to minimally cured.  Okay, I know that waiting this long is not practical in many circumstances---you can probably get away with curing for 4 hours at 90 degrees (but don't go much higher than 90 degrees), and \"take it easy\" for a couple of days.WHEN TO USE OTHER EPOXIESFor materials other than metal, particularly for rigid plastics, other epoxies are usually better than JB Weld.  Some epoxies are clear, or white, or specialized for particular purposes.  For exampleCLEARBOND H-3S Clear Strong Epoxy Adhesive Syringe - .85ozWHEN TO USE QUICK-EPOXIESOrdinary (slow) epoxies (whether JB Weld or other epoxies) dry harder than quick epoxies and are generally the best choice.  Maximum strength is the whole point of epoxies--if you don't need maximum strength---you probably do not need epoxy.  Use quick epoxies when 1) the hardening speed is essential, 2) when the item cannot be supported in the required orientation while the epoxy sets (at least several hours), or 3) when you have to absolutely minimize flowage.  Super-glue is often a good alternative in such situations.WHEN TO USE OTHER CEMENTS OR GLUESWhile epoxies are ideal for a few specific uses (primarily when you need a rigid cement for metal or rigid plastic)--there are many situations when other types of glue are better choices.  Epoxies are generally NOT recommended for flexible surfaces, such as leather, wood, or flexible plastic, and generally do not adhere well to glass, etc.  While epoxies may work with porous surfaces (paper, wood, ceramics, etc.), other adhesives are usually better.White Glue: For most light-duty indoor household applications which do not have to be waterproof, ordinary household white glue is safe, cleanup is very easy, and in most cases repairs are redo-able if you make a mistake.  White glue shrinks a great deal as it dries, and so is not good for filling holes or large gaps.  For example:Elmer's All Multipurpose White Glue, 7 5/8 oz. (E379)Glue Stick: Think of glue sticks as thick white household glue in stick form.  Glue sticks are great with paper, but have few other applications.Avery Glue Stic, 0.26 oz, Pack of 6, (98095)Wood Glue: Carpenters's wood glue is essentially water-proof (when dry) white household glue.  It penetrates and strengthens the wood better than any other type of glue. It is safe, and cleanup is easy. If the joint breaks again (because the wood is weak), it can be re-glued. For example:Elmer's E701 Carpenter's Wood Glue 8-OunceGoop:  Goop will bond virtually any material, including leather, plastics, glass, and metal.  The bond is clear, VERY strong, waterproof, and hard but flexible.  Since Goop is clear, if a little extra oozes out, it is barely noticeable. I've used Goop to repair ceramic plant pots, water hoses, and shoes; to seal holes in air-mattresses, to close small holes in window screens, as plumbers paste in assembling plumbing parts, to  I also use it to seal rust spots on my dishwasher rack--the Goop it also makes a \"cushioned\" surface that will prevent scratches to dishes.  Goop is particular good for repairing damaged electrical cords.Amazing Goop All-Purpose Household Goop, 3.7-Ounce Tube #130012Silicon Glue: Silicon glue is best for glass, and when you want a truly flexible connection (for example, to absorb vibrations). It is a good alternative for Goop for general household use on glass, plastic, and metal when you do not need the maximum possible strength. It is safer than Goop, and cleanup is easier. Like Goop, silicon glue takes days to reach reasonable strength, weeks to reach maximum strength. For example:GE Silicone II Household Glue, 2.8 ozFabric Glue:Beacon Fabri-Tac Permanent Adhesive, 4-Ounceworks amazingly well on fabrics, saturating the surfaces enough to provide a very strong bond, but without soaking through.  Depending on the application, fabric glue can be better than sewing.  It remains very flexible, e.g., it would probably be great on leather or heavy vinyl (e.g., women's handbags, shoes, luggage, etc.)Super-Glue (Krazy Glue): Super-glue is very strong, rigid, and fast. In many ways it is similar to 2-minute epoxy---except that no mixing is required. Although very hard, super-glue is brittle, and so, is not recommended for flexible objects. Super-glue is hazardous in that it can easily glue fingers (etc.) together.  Previously, I used super-glue frequently on objects (e.g., jewelry) when a clear bond was required---however, Goop is better for such applications, safer, and more conveneient. Opened super-glue keeps poorly, even in tighly sealed glass containers---so I recommended packages of multiple very small tubes.BAZIC Super Glue, 3 grams 0.10 ounces, 6 Per PackLiquid Nails/Construction Adhesive:  When you need to permanently join a large amount of surface, of almost any kind, Construction Adhesive is usually ideal. If you need to join 2 2x4s to make a 4x4 Construction Adhesive is better than nails.  Most construction adhesives are slightly flexible, and so can even be used on leather (i.e., to repair a loose shoe sole), etc.  Construction adhesive may leave a stain on porous surfaces, and may stain-through thin surfaces.  For small projects, Goop is usually a better choice.Caulking Compound:  You can think of caulking compound as white household glue with alot of inert filler--to use when you need to fill holes.  As an adhesive, it is the weakest on this list, but is strong enough for many purposes when spread over a large surface, such as the back of a ceramic tile.  A few years ago, I made a brick column to support a mailbox.  Traditionally, I should have used mortar--which would have been very time consuming.  I could have used construction adhesive (albeit any excess that squeezed out would have been ugly)--but caulking compound was quick, cheap, looks good, and was more than adequate for the job.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Does the Job", "unixReviewTime": 1332892800, "reviewTime": "03 28, 2012"}

Since we like the wipes but no longer trust the canister, we dump the contents (wipes and fluid) into a large zip-loc bag for safekeeping. That works well, but we really should not have to do this... so, four stars instead of five.Other Armor All products that we really like are the tire foam (Armor All Tire Foam Protectant 20 oz (1 lb 4 oz) 567 g) which produces a rich looking satin finish, the leather wipes (ArmorAll Leather Wipes Canister, 20 Wipes - Cleans, Conditions and Protects) which are great on my GT's leather seats, and the protectant (Armor All 10228 Original Protectant - 28 oz.) is excellent on the dash and all interior and exterior rubber.Highly recommend this product if you have a similar need... but think about keeping them in a zip-loc bag or something with a good seal.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Armor All Cleaning Wipes - Very good cleaning wipe - cannister is hit or miss though", "unixReviewTime": 1359331200, "reviewTime": "01 28, 2013"}

It is NOT a stabilizer bar..it's a sway bar.. took me a while to get it...I prefer to have the sway bar for my small camper..plus it's easy to remove or even loosen..which you really have to do to turn around in tight spaces. The thing will screech as you turn! The sway bar is sup to allow your camper to do some sway just not very much sway. if you over tighten it, it will not work properly..when the wind hits you, both the camper and the car will feel the pull back and forth.. you don't want that.. you want the camper to be able to have some sway with the wind. This product is great because you can adjust the amount of tension for low winds/high winds.

I'm not sure, but it does make sense that if you purchase this battery or any others in their line and you do purchase a charger in the same transaction they would probably honor the warranty extension, but I would check with them first.  The bottom line however, is that these batteries are so well made that they will probably outlast a standard battery 5 times over, so what's the logical point to extend the warranty to two years to begin with.

Why they don't come stock on this trailer is beyond me, but it would seem many smaller campers only have them in the rear.  Anyway, first impressions: quality manufacturing (yes, made in China ironically) and solid.  When I set these next to my factory jacks that came with my Ameri-Lite 16BHC, it was immediately evident that the Camco versions were much more solid.  Overall, they are just &#34;thicker&#34; - more steel was used when making them.I was worried for a moment because it felt like both were locked into their closed positions, so before I went through the trouble of bolting them on (which required drilling through my travel trailer's steel frame), I made sure they opened by clamping them to a solid surface in my home and opening them.  They were tight, but eventually I got them to open without issue.Installation wasn't complicated, but slightly laborious.  Drilling through solid steel is never a fun time when you're on your back in the driveway!  :)  The instructions call for them to be extended, then your frame marked with a punch via a hammer, then remove jacks, then pilot drill a small hole, a following it up with the bolt-size 11/32&#34; bit.All I did was fully extend them where I wanted them, drilled the small pilot hole while they were holding the bottom of my frame up, then removed them, then drilled the larger 11/32&#34; hole - MUCH EASIER.  No need to use a punch.These come pretty dry from the factory, so plan on lubricating them with some lithium grease or similar to help them collapse/extend and protect them from rusting.  My 2013 Ameri-Lite 16BHC came with scissor jacks that were already showing corrosion just by sitting on the sales lot (purchased in May 2013).  We'll see how these Camco versions hold up, but so far they're awesome.

That means only half the oil filter was working.Next is the seem were the pleated rows are connected. It was open half way up the seam because the glue came loose!  That means dirty oil was by passing the filter all together.  These are the worst filters on the market no doubt. Fram just spent so much money blowing smoke up our tails we believe they are good filters....Cut your old fram open and look inside. If you dont want to get dirty just go too youtube and type in fram oil filter. NOTHING BUT GARBAGE! Fram could'nt care less about the life of your car. Buy anything else but fram!

Maybe the 100 watt model would be better than these 130's if your eyes are sensitive to bright lights.  Exactly what my 2004 Dodge Ram needed because the factory headlights stink.  My brights were no brighter than my low beam, and my old 1985 Nissan had brighter brights, but these KC 130 watt driving lights solved that problem perfectly.  For not being the full, long range lights KC offers, they sure shine pretty far, plus spread the light out to the sides and up into the trees, a good long range / flood combination.  I mounted them to my push/brush guard.  Took about 3 hours to install because I like to route, hide, and secure the wires very well.  I connected the white switch / relay hot wire to my high beam (brights)wire on the drivers side, so they go on and off with my high / low switch, plus I have the master switch mounted (without the switch frame) near the dash to keep the KC lights off completely if I want.  Just make sure you dim your lights (turn off the KC's) before you see anyone ahead of you or you'll blind them and can get a ticket if on a public road.  First night I tried them a big 8 point ran across the road in front of me, then stopped and pretty much \"tip toed\" off the road as if he was totally blind and afraid to move.  So beware of animals freezing in front of you with these things.  I turned them off and honked so he could run away.  And no, I don't hunt that way.The wiring diagram on the outside of the box did not show the white power / relay wire, as if it was pre-wired into the main power wire, but luckily there was the white power / relay wire available to tap into my high beam wire.  The wiring diagram on the directions in the box was correct.  Some vehicles newer than 1999 may not allow tapping into the high beam wire because of the vehicle's computer that senses voltage changes, but it worked on mine.  Only thing I had to supply was a sheet metal screw to secure the relay.  I cut off about 5 feet of extra wire that went to the switch.

I purchased my '10 RX8 in May 2010 with 16 miles on the clock and have been babying her ever since. After a few goes at conventional oil to break in the engine, I switched over to the RP after some great suggestions by the rx8 community. In doing so I took care to be very meticulous about my oil changes, performing them every 3000 miles, and saving samples to send to Blackstone labs just to make sure that the oil was doing a good job and that my engine was healthy. I ran the RP 5w30 in the winter, and then ran their 10w40 in the summer and had absolutely no problems. Once I changed out my first interval of the 10w40, I sent the samples over to BSL (~$40 total to sample both) to check the results. Although the numbers were above average, the Viscosity numbers were a tad low .... not alarmingly low, but I expected them to be stable considering that this is a premium oil. The guys over at BSL assured me that this was completely normal, and because my car only has 10k miles on it now, it could just be residuals from breakin/conventional oil use/some 5w30 that stayed in the sump when i put the 10w40. In any case, I sent my reports over to the folks at RP just to have them take a look-see. Within a few hours I got back a reply from the RP team pretty much confirming what the guys over at BSL said. Along with that, they stated that they wanted to continue monitoring my use just to be 100% sure that their assumptions are correct. They sent me free sample kits and told me to send them some samples when I do an oil change again.There aren't that many companies out there that A. produce a fantastic product, B. advertise without bogus claims, and most importantly C. stand by their product 100%. If anything, this company got my respect and loyalty due to their immediate response and their handling of my concerns. Now again, let me stress, my oil analysis numbers were fantastic and were exactly what was expected of a newer car...but just because I had concerns the folks at RP asked me to send them over more samples so they can run an analysis free of charge.I hope that helps most of you that are still on the fence about trying this product even though it has a fantastic quality reputation.

I'll review the trans fluid there (Royal Purple Synchromax) since that made a huge difference.  My car runs much quieter and smoother after the fluid changes.  I can not really tell if this oil made a difference in the differential since I did several changes at once but it definitely didn't make things worse.  The old differential oil came out completely clear and was as much fluid as expected so I'm pretty sure things have been running as expected back there.After I had already ordered this I found that some BMW owners run Mobil 1 gear oil in the differential since it is said to run cooler there than RP or Redline oil.  So I could have saved several dollars per quart and maybe gotten better performance, but I don't drive the car hard so this will do just fine. 5 stars since my car is running so much better that I'll give some credit to this oil.Update 06/2012 - Several tanks of gas later and my MPG is higher.  Since I replaced the trans fluid and this at the same time, not sure which or if both made the difference.  Really improved the highway MPG, and it just did 32.09 MPG, doing the relatively flat round trip Los Angeles to Palm Springs plus some other mainly highway driving.

These jacks stands are very well made of heavy gauge aluminum with a hardened steel pin with a bearing lock for the height adjustment.

Another reviewer stated that his stand 'wobbled'. While it's possible that reviewers stand was defective, if the screw is threaded into the hole and tightened down firmly into the base, the stand won't wobble. On my SUV vehicle, the jack points are very close together, so the base of a tripod-style jack stand is too wide for use.  The narrow profile of these stands is perfect and allows me to slip the jack stand behind the jack and under the rear jack point. Once in position, remove the pin, adjust the height and reinsert the pin. I also don't care for the ratchet style jack stands, which have been known to fail.

I think some folks recieved a knock off and therefore you might need to varify items part number and maybe even UPC number before ordering anywere online. Make sure it says MAXSA on the package and you have the correct one.It is very easy to setup,I measured our car first. Our Infiniti from dash center {were I wanted laser} to the front bumper was about 6ft. I then measured in my garage were I wanted the cars dash to be when I parked witch came out to be approx 9-10 ft from front wall. Thats 6 FT + 3 to 4FT for mower and walking space in front of car.Mine ended up being located in front of my garage door opener so my cars about 3-4 feet in my garage door when it detects it. That way it will light up just before I get to parking location I chose and laser wont stop shining before I park like some reported.My door opener dont seem to interfere with sensor even though its located between door and laser. Its a good sensor IMO. I aimed the laser on the center of my dash using a long stick while car was parked and the way I have it as long as the light is on the dash area rather all the way forward,centered or on the the edge of the dash the cars clear and your parking is fine.Since my laser is just above the center of the dash area and points straight down on the dash area, it leaves about a foot in either direction front or rear for some error. It seems to work well like this. It took about 15 min total to setup.CAUTION: Wives/husbands may act like they dont need a garage laser and it was a stupid waste of money.

It is safe because it has been used for years in Chevron gasoline.  The highest concentration of it are in the premium grade.  There have been lots of studies done on Techron.  The only difference between a bottle of this and the Techron in the pump at the gas station is that the Techron in this bottle is a much higher concentration. The reviewer who said that Chevorn stations were disappearing did not know what he was talking about and as to his manual stating not to use additives that may or may not be the case but for Techron since it is in pump gas it makes no sense this product would be included.  It is designed to clean deposits in fuel injectors and carbs and to some degree help clean or prevent buildup of deposits on valves.  It may nor may not increase MPG, that is entirely dependent upon the issue you are having and how much a detergent added to your gas can clean. If your fuel injectors can have a better spray pattern then perhaps you could see minor increases in MPG.  It is more likely to help an engine run and idle smoother and have power closer to what it was new if the fuel system has become inefficient due to becoming dirty with deposits. In many instances it can help clean deposits to an extent where there is a noticeable improvement in how your engine idles because it has helped to unclog your fuel injectors.  Again it certainly is one product that will not in any event harm your engine. It also will very likely help keep those deposits from becoming an issue in the first place if used on occasion.  However this, like any other gas additive can only do so much. It is reasonable to try using it before moving on to a more expensive repair, but no gas additive can take the place of a mechanical cleaning or replacement or a fuel injector or repair of a damaged engine.  So if you are going to use a cleaning fuel additive this is one of the best and the safest to try.  Just remember there is no \"engine rebuild in a can\" and the bulk of products such as oil additive mask serious wear issues at best.  If you have relatively minor issues that could be helped by cleaning of the fuel delivery system this is one of the first easiest steps to take, along with changing fuel filters and any other maintenance that your car may need such as replacing spark plugs.  If this does not work there are machines at shops that are made for cleaning fuel injectors and related systems such as MotoVac which runs a cleaning fluid in a closed loop for a long period of time.  That is a step up from adding something to your tank. If that fails than a mechanical remedy is needed.  The only other two products I would consider using are made by Redline and Lucas.  They make good products in general and have had good reviews on their fuel system cleaners.  So feel safe trying this but don't expect miracles.  Proper engine maintenance is going to be your best and lowest cost way to avoid repairs and keep your car running like new more than any other thing you can do.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It is one of the few good fuel additives but not magic", "unixReviewTime": 1308268800, "reviewTime": "06 17, 2011"}

It did a nice job.  While the title of the product says wax, it makes a good quick detailer as well.  As a matter of fact, given the watery consistency of the product, I would argue that it is in fact a quick detailer.  Regarding leaving streaks, I own a  black colored car and most quick detailers that I tried will leave some mimimal marks depending on the time of day when I use  them.  So don't worry about streaking.  I am using this product along side of Chemical Guys Pro Detailer ( a mix of carnauba and synthetic polymers).  They both work equally well leaving that \"just waxed\" slick feeling. In all honesty, the more I try quick detailers, the more I think they are all about the same in what they do.  They make your car look great but are no substitute for a good wax/polish. The next detailer I plan to tryout is Finish Kare 425 Extra Slick Final Body Shine.

{"reviewerID": "A34ZS78ACD3D7Z", "asin": "B0009IBJAS", "reviewerName": "Kent", "helpful": [127, 131], "reviewText": "I see a lot of negative reviews for this charger that I think are partially due to Amazon's incorrect description and the fact that most people don't know what size or type of charger they need. (including myself)I am a practicing Electronic engineer with more than 20yrs experience. I did not know much about battery chargers until recently researching what a good battery charger should do.1) this charger only delivers a max of 1.5A. This means if you try to charge a discharged auto battery (48AH) it will take a long long time. This charger does work great for topping off a car battery at 70% (12.4V).2) The instructions included clearly state the charger will automatically shut-off after 12 hours of charging. The charger will restart and continue charging if you unplug and then plug the charger in again. Best to get a higher capacity charger.3) This charger does have a float mode sort of. Actually it shuts off the charging current and monitors battery voltage. When the battery voltage drops low enough the charger cycles on to top it off and then shuts off again.MY SUMMARY 1st:I like this charger and think it does a good job for the PRICE. Gold box special was $15.20 + tax. (I would definitely buy it at the regular price for $3$)It's basically automatic. Don't have to set the voltage and it won't damage anything if you reverse the clips accidently. Compact size and reasonable quality clamps.This charger does what it is designed for. That is charge small batteries and top off larger automotive batteries. This is an excellent maintenance charger for all batteries to keep them fully charged when not in use. (My opinion)Personally I would not leave any charger connected to my battery for more than 24 hours. Now I use a cheap mechanical timer that is set to turn on for 1 hour every 24 hours. I would prefer a timer that I can set to turn on twice a week for a few hours.The charger is small feels solidly built with heavy plastic. It gets very warm aftercharging at 1.5A but not warm enough to be concerned. (no cooling fan)I gave this charger 5 stars because PRICE and performance is very good. Build quality is good as well.AMAZON DESCRIPTION (Poor): is incorrect in that this charger is not intended to be used to charge a LOW (discharged) car battery. The chart in the DESCRIPTION that shows the charging times is different than the manual.. The included MANUAL has a chart that states this charger should only be used as a \"top off\" or maintenance charger for auto batteries. In addition the charger in charging mode automatically shuts off after 12 hours of charging. (A good safety feature in my opinion.)Charging details:I discharged a car/truck jump start battery pack to 12.45V or approx 75% charge.(Typical full charge is 12.65V to 12.7V. To discharge the battery I used a battery/alternator tester. I have a voltmeter attached to charger and a current meter in series with battery and battery charger negative terminal.1) At the start of the charge, the charge current was 0.78A and then jumped to 1.52A in a few minutes.2) After 1 hour the charge current is 1.47A. Charge voltage is 13.0V.3) After 2 hours the charge current is 1.48A. Charge voltage is 13.25V.4) After 3 hours the charge current is 1.43A. Charge voltage is 13.46V.5) After 4 hours the charge current is 1.40A. Charge voltage is 13.82V.Note: that the charge current is decreasing as the battery is approaching full charge. This design feature will prevent overheating and extend the life of your battery.6) After 5 hours the charge current is 0.68A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.7) After 5.5 hours the charge current is 0.35A. Charge voltage is 14.67V.8) After 6 hours the charge current is 0.29A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.9) After 6.5 hours the charge current is 0.24A. Charge voltage is 14.72V.10) After 8.5 hours the charge current is 0.20A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.11) After 10.5 hours the charge current is 0.15A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.12) After 11.5 hours the charge is COMPLETE and the charge current has dropped to 0.0A. BATTERY voltage is 13.55V and declining. Charger is in the monitor mode. In monitor mode the charger AC power is 3W measured with a Belkin Watt meter.Almost 12 hours seems like a long time to charge a battery and this isn't even a full capacity car battery. But, it did a good job of gently charging the battery especially when it was near full charge. The important thing to me is the charging current declined as the battery neared full charge. This prevents overcharging and truly tops off the battery to maximum capacity.I tested the battery the next day with a battery tester and it passed well within the \"good battery\" full charge limits. The results were much better than the charger that came with the battery pack where it tested NEAR \"weak\".Very happy with the purchase. I would buy this exact model again.

{"reviewerID": "A30UFXOF0GS9NM", "asin": "B0009IBJE4", "reviewerName": "Chris Dragon", "helpful": [4, 5], "reviewText": "Another reviewer mentioned this charger puts out 15.0V in AGM mode and that's too many volts for some AGM batteries and it caused his to outgas (reducing the battery's life).  My Optima yellow top AGM battery is rated for 15V charging so I thought this charger would be okay for it, but the charger I got puts out 15.5V!  I did find specs that say 15.6V \"regulated voltage\" is okay for \"rapid charging\" on my battery but they don't define what rapid charging means.  They do say with 15.6V to \"charge until current drops below 1 amp\" which I think means you can do 15.6V until the battery gets closer to being charged and stops accepting high amperage.  Unfortunately this charger does the exact opposite, starting at lower voltage and increasing to 15.5V around when it decides the battery is at 90% charge (which seems to equate to about 12.6 or 12.7V on my battery).  The charger keeps outputting 15.5V until the battery is fully charged, which may take hours, so it seems unlikely that's good for most batteries and I'm pretty sure it's against the charging specs on my battery.  Note that the charger shows 15.4V on its readout but my volt meter shows it's actually 15.5V.Nevertheless I let it keep doing 15.5V and checked periodically to make sure the battery wasn't hot (it never even felt warm and an IR temperature gun read 86F max) and wasn't hissing (hissing would mean it was overcharged and releasing gas, permanently reducing its life).  It took almost exactly 12 hours for the charger to decide it was 100% charged and go into maintenance mode, but when it did, it picked 12.4V!  AGM batteries are supposed to be charged at around 13.6V for maintenance (float) charging, so I have no idea why it picked 12.4V.  I left it on for another hour and it actually reduced the voltage to 12.3, at which point I took it off the charger.  Volt meter said the battery was at 12.31V.I can't decide if this charger is broken, has a weird charging algorithm, or is actually very smart.  I say that because my battery was discharged to about 3.5V a few weeks ago, well below the voltage it's designed to be discharged to (it's a \"deep cycle\" but even deep cycles don't tolerate discharging below 50%, and even below 10.5V may hurt them), so it's now damaged and won't hold the full 13.6V it's supposed to.  Instead, if I leave it on the charger at 15.5V for an hour, it hits 12.8V and then quickly loses charge to 12.5V in about 30 minutes.  So maybe the charger somehow figured that out and decided that 12.4V was \"full charge\" on my damaged battery so that's what it used as its float charge.  I don't see how it could determine that if the battery was 12.8V or higher after the long 15.5V charge, but who knows.I also don't know if 15.4V is really bad for my battery, or for the \"average AGM\".  I spent awhile researching but couldn't find any real authoritative information, just a bunch of people theorizing.  Since it's above the 15V standard charge on the battery spec sheet I don't think it's a good thing, but then again I also found research (nrel dot gov/vehiclesandfuels/energystorage/pdfs/evs17pres.pdf) showing that seriously overvolting a yellow top battery to 17V under certain conditions actually increases its life.  So I don't know what to think, but I'm leaning towards thinking it's a bad thing to go against the manufacturer's spec sheet unless you're in a lab using specialized chargers.What I do know is that the desulfination feature on this charger didn't do a thing for my damaged battery.  In fact I don't think it even kicked in.  I connected the charger to a small sealed lead acid battery that I left unused for too long and it went into desulfination mode (I think - the manual doesn't say how you're supposed to know) for over 8 hours pumping 16.8V into the battery until it said \"bad bat\" on its screen and stopped charging.  In all that time the battery never showed over 15% charged on the charger, though it did end up holding about 10.9V.  In my online research it was mentioned in a few places that there are no studies showing desulfination actually works so I'm pretty dubious about it.  It definitely didn't work on either of my batteries.It was also interesting to note that the sealed lead acid battery never got warm, which I find rather curious considering how long it was putting in such a high voltage.  I had the charger connected to a kill-a-watt meter and it showed the charger was pulling only 0.15amps and 9watts, and this is in 2amp charging mode, so maybe the charger is smart enough to use low amperage when it's using high voltage and that prevents the battery from getting damaged.  When it was pushing 15.4V to my AGM battery it was only drawing 0.35amps and it actually reduced the amps to 0.29 as it got closer to 100% charged.  So maybe that protects the battery from overvoltage damage, but I don't know enough to be sure.  Maybe a battery expert will chime in in the comments.Another important thing to consider is that desulfination mode could damage your car's electronics if you don't remove the battery from the car to charge it.  16.8V is more than most cars were designed to handle, and I found someone mentioning that BMW warns not to use chargers that do things like that, so it's definitely a concern.  I don't know if I feel comfortable using this charger again without removing the battery from the car.  Some chargers claim to somehow magically detect the presence of car electronics and limit their voltage, but this charger says nothing about that in its manual.Other than all that, the design of the charger is nice.  Wires fit into a pocket beneath the retractable handle.  It will show you the battery voltage on its readout until you tell it to start charging (although it reads 0.1 to 0.2V lower than my volt meter, which is annoying).  A button lets you toggle between display of voltage or battery percent.  It lets you choose standard, AGM, and gel cell, and choose from three rates of charge.  The slower 2A charge rate is supposed to be better for many batteries, so use 2A or 6A if you aren't in a hurry.  I tried both those modes and it still puts out 15.5V in 6A mode but it puts out 15.3V in 2A mode.Since this is a dedicated 12V charger you don't have to worry about it \"autodetecting\" (actually, auto-misdetecting) your discharged 12V battery as a 6V and never charging it past 6V, which is a problem with far too many chargers these days.Despite its nice controls and smart form factor, I give this charger a low rating because I think it tries to push some batteries beyond their limits in the name of charging them as quickly or as fully as possible.  One reviewer said it caused his AGM to outgas and another said it burnt out his battery after a few months of trickle charge mode.  If you have the right brand of battery that can handle this charger's output, and your battery isn't damaged, it's probably fine, but the fact that it can damage things and may even damage car electronics in desulfination mode strikes me as very bad design, especially given that desulfination seems like more of a marketing ploy than a valuable feature.  I also don't like that its volt meter reads 0.1 to 0.2V under actual voltage.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "May damage car electronics or AGM batts, desulfination worthless on 2 batts", "unixReviewTime": 1382832000, "reviewTime": "10 27, 2013"}

If you like a real deep interior shine go with the Supreme Shine Protectant.  This Natural Shine protectant works awesome on all plastic, rubber, vinyl.  And as the description states, it's also a UV PROTECTANT so in addition to looking incredible, it also protects your interior!  I do use the Meguiar's Quik interior Detailer as well but I use that interchangeably along with this.  Because the Natural Shine Protectant is a liquid type cream it takes a little longer to apply as I massage it into the seats, dash, and interior panels of the doors.  The Quick Interior Detailer is more of a mist type spray that can be easily applied in half the time but also has protectants in it as well. So in a rush, the quik interior detailer is great, but every couple of months you definitely want to use this stuff if you want longer lasting protection and a \"LIKE-NEW\" SHINE.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Probably my Favorite of all Meguiar's products!", "unixReviewTime": 1300147200, "reviewTime": "03 15, 2011"}

They are of high quality, effective, easy to find, and affordable (while being as good as expensive boutique products in the opinion of many \"car crazy,\" people like myself).Meguiar's Gold Class Liquid Wax is another example of that experience. Meguiar's effectively markets this wax and who doesn't love using something called Gold Class that comes in beautiful packaging? However, it is not smoke and mirrors. Inside the tin is a very good wax that will greatly enhance your paint's finish, while providing all-important protection.Today, liquid waxes tend to be more popular, and Gold Class is certainly available in liquid.  Both versions are the same formula and provides the same benefits and results according to Meguiar's.  However, call me old fashioned, but there is something about applying a paste wax that I enjoy.  I find it fun, and the tin and packaging of this paste wax is really gorgeous.  It feels like something that is valuable and of the highest quality.  I like that!For optimum results I strongly encourage you before you apply Gold Class, to clay your car (Meguiar's Smooth Surface Clay Kit works great), clean with a paint cleaner (i.e. Deep Crystal Step 1), optionally polish with a pure polish (Deep Crystal Step 2 or #7 Show Car Polish), and then apply this wax. The results are truly remarkable. Again, I have used many waxes to top off my detailing, and Gold Class is one I keep going back to.

I've been using it for years on various cars, and I've yet to find something that works better. It helps bring my Evo to a show worthy clean and shine.A couple cap fulls of this in my pressure washer bottle suds up great, same with my Gilmour Foamaster. It does a great job at cutting through mud and dirt, and even bird droppings if you get to it soon enough. Where I live it rains 2-3x a week so I try to keep my car waxed to reduce washes, but I still end up washing it down once every 1-2 weeks. If I stay on top of it, with this and my pressure washer - I don't have to touch my car with a mit or towel for cleanings. This works that well to clean a car of all dirt, grime, and bugs. However if you let it go a month and it's not waxed, then you'll probably have to mit clean it. The only time I use a different soap is usually the first couple weeks after a wax (assuming it's not caked on dirty somehow) I useMeguiar's Wash and Wax - 48 oz.to preserve the wax job and bring it back to a little more of a shine.To wash - I highly recommend a cheap electric pressure washer with a soap bottle. You can find them around 100-150$, and if you frequently wash your car it's well worth it. My philosophy is the less times I have to touch my car the lower probability of miro-marring and swirl marks. If you have to mitt clean, do as high powered of a rinse you can with a hose to get off the bulk of dirt. I then recommend theMeguiar's Microfiber Wash Mitt, use two cheap 5 gallon buckets (you can get them for a couple bucks from HomeDepot), with aThe Grit Guard Insert (Red) - Fits 12 inch Diameter Bucketat the bottom. One bucket is clean rinse water the others your soap dunking water. The important tips I've found for avoiding marring is to frequently rinse and soap your mitt - don't let it start to get dry of soap/suds. Every single time you're about to rinse the mitt run your other hand over both sides and do a visible inspection, pick off ANYTHING you see. Rinse it, scrape along the grit guard if you need to, re-soap the mitt, then do another run of your hand against it and visible inspection. I can't tell you how many times I've picked something off the mitt, like a small piece a dirt or pebble or leaf/twig part that would've likely marked up the clear coat. Also usually you do not need to apply a lot of pressure, even for caked on grime. Lightly drag it so if there is dirt on the mitt it's less likely to scratch. The only other advice I have is to use at least 2 mitts per car. Reserve at least one for any hotspots on the car that get a lot of dirt - like around your rear wheel wells, rear bumper around exhaust, maybe even your front bumper if you've got it caked with bugs from a long road trip. I save those spots for last with the separate mitt so it keeps all that gunk out of the buckets and off the rest of my car. It's also useful to have another mitt if you drop yours on the ground or it touches any high dirty areas, it's great to set it aside for the washer and use another for now.I usually use a CRSpotless DI filter system to rinse the car off afterwards to a spot free shine. I have however used this and just hosed it off afterwards, and it does a pretty decent job by itself at leaving a fairly spot-free shine (obviously not completely). I'd say it's better then the Mother's wash I tried in this regard. Otherwise it's pretty comparable to the Mother's wash, although I tend to think this cuts through caked on dirt just a bit better. If you don't want a CRSpottless system you can buy the big blue filter housing and a DI filter to build your own for around 100-200$ (I did this after my crspotless system cracked over one winter). If you go the towel dry method I'd recommendMeguiar's Water Magnet Drying Towel- you'll have to ring it out a couple times (maybe buy two), but it's soft and pretty safe to use. Just make sure you don't let it touch the ground or anything else covered in dirt - or you will mar/scratch it during drying.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best car soap available", "unixReviewTime": 1382832000, "reviewTime": "10 27, 2013"}

It makes a thick, sudsy formula and lathers your car with it. I feel like my cars have never been washed to this extent--it's like a car wash in my driveway. I use a car wash brush like the Carrand 93089 Flow-Thru 10&#34; Wash Brush found on Amazon, which makes it so much easier to wash the car. The whole job is done in about 15 minutes.

Santic \"topofmurrayhill\"", "helpful": [1, 3], "reviewText": "This is a petroleum-based product with a consistency something like a thick mineral oil. Meguiar's Gold Class produces a different sort of shine than some other tire dressings. Your tires look more oiled than wet when it's first applied, fading to a more subtle but nice sheen over the course of a few days. The advantage of this product is that it will get you through a rainstorm or a washing without totally coming off. Even after the shine fades, your tires stay black for some time instead of going gray or brown. If you're looking for that super wet and glossy look, Meguiar's Gold Class will get you a good part of the way there but might not satisfy you 100%. However, if you'd like a tire dressing that improves the look of your car without requiring a new application any time it gets wet, you'll find this product very useful.And by the way, it's purple and grapey, which is irrelevant but not unwelcome.UPDATE: Reluctantly, I'm demoting my review to three stars. I've gotten a lot of use from my first bottle, with pretty good results as described above, but I don't intend to buy more because the product is too difficult and messy to use. The syrupy consistency requires more effort to achieve good coverage, especially if your radials tend to squash down a lot where they meet the ground (with my latest tires, I actually have to move the car to get full coverage). It can't be washed out of your applicator, which will eventually turn black. The black goo then spreads to your hands when you dress your tires and outlines your fingernails, making it very difficult to get your hands clean. If you wear gloves, you still have to deal with a very greasy and dirty pair of gloves. I feel I need a spray product or at least one that spreads easily.

However, not only does it not really add much to the overall look, but the application method is all wrong.This product comes as a spray, and is designed, as per the instructions, to spray right onto the tires.  After doing so, it does make the areas where applied shiny, but the application is uneven, and even then, because it's a mist, it goes everywhere (onto the paint, the wheels, etc), which is bad.  So you end up having to use something like a paper towel or a cloth to spread the product evenly, which ends up removing most of the product (and making a mess overall).  Then the shine is gone.This product would be better made as a bottle that is made to apply to a pad or some other applying tool, as the spray is too difficult to control to get it only on the tires.Since evening it out also means removing most of the shine, whatever soaks in leaves a dull but darker look.  So, in the end, the best it was able to do was darken the tires slightly.  The product briefly mentions protective qualities, so a star for that, but it seems like an afterthought in the advertising materials, so I'm somewhat doubtful about that.  So overall, this product doesn't seem worthwhile; it's more trouble than it's worth.  It basically made a mess, made the tires darker, but duller looking, and made the logos/letters/numbers on the tires less visible, which in the end made it look less cool than before.  So, I won't be using this particular product again.Other Meguiar's products are great; but this one is not an essential.  It seems like a very niche product that one would only need for special photo shoots, etc, in a controlled environment, but not as an everyday car polishing tool.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Not worth it", "unixReviewTime": 1402099200, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2014"}

I am a bit nuts about taking care of my car, and I have added these towels to my giant bucket of car care supplies. After doing a standard two bucket wash with Meguiar's soap and microfiber wash mitt, my first step is to go over the whole car with an electric leaf blower. I keep my car waxed, so the water beads well, and the blower takes care of 90% of the drying work. I quickly follow up with the Water Magnet Drying Towel to get the few bits that the blower leaves. This minimizes the amount of rubbing I have to do, which (at least in my opinion) helps to prolong the life of the wax job. With this towel, one light pass over the wet spots is all it takes, and it leave a streak-free dry car. Since most of the water is gone after blowing it off, I never get close to saturating the towel, but I can tell from how much of the towel I do use that it will hold quite a bit. Even the part of the towel that has become damp is still drying in one pass. I can't speak for the $25+ towels, but I couldn't ask for a \"car towel\" to do any more than this towel does at only a few dollars.

Not having really used microfiber clothes for this purpose before, I chose these since I went with the other Mejuiar's products and the reviews seemed decent enough. So I have nothing to compare it too, but these did the job. Over a weekend I applied both the polish and wax on a Chrysler 300C and used these three towels and the one that came with the wax, and did the entire job with no problem. One thing to note though, the finish of my vehicle is in great shape, thank you very much. I used claybar before the polish and wax so the surface was very smooth to begin with. Honestly I would not waste money on nice clothes if it were not.When I was done with the job, I cleaned these by hand in a sink using a little liquid laundry detergent. I let them soak for about 20 minutes and then hand scrubbed them to remove a few black marks. I rinsed them well and hung them out to dry. They seem to be back to there original condition only showing slight wear. I suspect they will last for some time and at this price point replacing them is not a big deal. Oh and the tag comes off very easy, which I have read in reviews for other products, is not always the case. It does say right on the tag to remove it too.I might try a few other clothes in the future just to see if there is a big difference, but for my money these performed well and I can recommend them to anyone looking for a good microfiber cloth to remove wax or polish.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Removed Polish and Wax with No Problems", "unixReviewTime": 1402272000, "reviewTime": "06 9, 2014"}

As another reviewer mentioned, they are basically a foam pad on the inside with a microfiber cloth wrapped around the exterior.  This literally gives the best of both worlds!  The foam interior gives the pad shape which allows for an even application of wax.  The microfiber outside makes sure that you don't scratch your car as you apply it.  Also, I've noticed that for liquid waxes in particular, a sponge applicator seems to absorb a lot of the wax into the sponge itself, which is sort of a waste.  A rolled up microfiber towel avoids this absorption but it is very unwieldy and it's difficult to apply a smooth and even pressure on.  Again, these applicators solves those issues by combining the two.  Also, these pads are a nice size, probably about 5 inches in diameter, which allows you to cover a large area very quickly.  I find the pads that come with many wax kits to be far too small, which just means more work for you to cover your car.

On an older vehicle, this can also clean out your carburetor, which normally can become troublesome with age. Like I said earlier, MMO is also a trade secret to those who race cars, many will swear by this product.MMO can also be used in RV's, which use diesel engines or the big rigs as well. It can also be used in, boats, ATV's, and landscaping equipment such as, mowers, trimmers, blowers. I also like MMO, cause it can be used in the oil crankcase of every engine. Over time, your engine can develop carbon deposits, having MMO in the crankcase will clean out these deposits. Then you can get rid of them at your next oil change.MY EXPERIENCE: My experience with MMO has been well, marvelous! I have been using it in my landscaping equipment for years now. And I find that machines, which I am treating with MMO, last longer then those that are not treated. For example, I can run MMO in the gas and oil of a Briggs V-Twin engine. I can then have another duplicate engine next to it without the MMO treatment.I can run both engines for 48 hours, and I can guarantee you, if I pull them both apart, the engine which was treated with MMO, will be the cleanest one. Another difference is with valve lifter ping, I am sure you have heard that from your engine before. Treat your engine with MMO, and I can guarantee you that the ping will go away. Why? Because, MMO cleans and lubricates your valve lifters.THE MANTIS TILLER: As some of you may know, I used to own a 2-cycle Mantis tiller. Well, after it was 3-years old, I was having some major troubles with it. What it needed was a carburetor rebuild kit, but since I was on the job, I had no time for that! I grabbed my bottle of MMO, which I bring with me, I applied two cap-fulls of this stuff to the tank. After running the engine at full throttle for 10-minutes, all of the sudden I gained engine power.

She asked if in \"temperature controlled environment\"?. I said in the garage where temp never exceeds 85 degrees and were kept in original packaging in a dark closet.  She said that was the problem.I told here that the original wipers on the Toyota Rav 4 were 3 years old and still functioned better than Rain-x that were 6 months old, stored properly,,,not exposed to elements and never used, and yet were far worse in smearing of windshield than the old originals.She then told me that they have 90 day warranty and with receipt I could return.  I said that I purchased 6 months ago and had kept for when I would need them.  She said that was too bad and there was nothing that could be done,,,,,that my improper storage was why they failed.I asked her if 3 year old originals that had been used and baked in the sun and elements were superior to Rain-X blades that had been stored properly for 6 months and unused.

Lisle places a drop of hot glue to the cardboard packaging to hold the tool in place while it is covered with shrink wrap. This would be ok if they used a small drop of glue instead of the giant blob the size of a quarter. After opening the package this giant glue blob ripped a large piece of the cardboard packaging with it that was super difficult to remove. I even shaved the sucker down with a razor knife before applying the solvent. The glue was some high quality stuff that was not easy to remove. I only wish I could find some glue this tough for my glue gun. It took me over one hour and quite a bit of Goo-Gone to rub it out enough to make the tool usable. New products should work as advertised straight out of the package without requiring an hour of rubbing and cleaning -- not to mention that Goo-Gone is not cheap! Simple aggravation is my only reason for knocking it down one star. My wife said that she has never seen me waste that much tool time on something that doesn't cost 10 minutes of billing time. I guess it is not in me to cut my losses and toss a brand new item in the trash when I should.The bristles are of a good quality that should last as long as reasonable force is applied when cleaning. Mechanics that jam these on either end without a little finesse are the cause of premature distorted bristles in my opinion. I don't think it is the tools fault. The bristles on the male end have a very slight distortion after the first use but nothing major that I don't experience on every other one I have ever used. As noted by other recent reviewers the male bristles are brass instead of stainless. I have both styles and think that both have advantages but am leaning towards the brass style since it looks better in a side to side comparison. I will buy again but do hope Lisle fixes the glue blob problem and I most likely will buy from a brick and mortar store so I can nake sure they're packaging robot didn't go nuts with the glue before I walk out of the store. I know Amazon has an excellent return service but personnally I hate to mail things back if I can possibly avoid it. It is time spent and that means lost money to me.Update: the glue mess that I experienced may have been an isolated incident as I have looked at a dozen or so hanging at local auto parts stores and they all had a very small drop of glue that didn't look anywhere near what I had to deal with. Note to Lisle if you reads these reviews -- find a way to package these tools without the need to glue them to the packaging since frustration free consumer packaging is both a current trend and you could save time and production costs to boot. Consider using a small piece of double sided tape instead.

I have used all the most popular detailers out there, but not one of them even comes close to this NXT Speed Detailer. They have taken Show room finish to a new level. I am just so amazed as to how beautiful my cars look now. Good job Meguiar's!!Pros:Clean your car in minutes without having to wash your car.A shine and wet look finish that is just so amazing that you have to see it to believe it.Very inexpensive. Cheaper than going to a car wash and more convenient. One bottle will last a very long time.Cleans the whole car exterior. Wheels, glass, plastic trim, rubber, headlights, tail lights and paint.Does not wash off with rain or car washes.Cons:It would be nice if they included a free Microfiber cloth, but no big deal.Summary:This is the best all around product you can buy to clean, beautify, and protect your car. Meguiar's has set the bar very high with this product.The proper way to detail your car FOR THE FIRST TIME is to do the ff:1. Wash your car with the NXT car wash. Dry.2. Use Mequiar's Clay bar.3. Apply NXT Speed Detailer on the entire exterior. Paint, Glass, Plastics, wheels, headlights, tail lights. I have even used this to clean and detail the engine compartment.4. Apply NXT Speed wax by hand or NXT Wax using a buffer to the paint.5. Apply Meguiar's Insane shine tire spray. No need to wipe tire. Just let it dry.For the succeeding cleaning, you will just need to do step 3, 4 and 5. This is the most efficient way to detail your car.  You can certainly buy the other Meguair's products specific to the task, but my way saves me so much time because I dont need to stop and switch products. 1 to 5 can be done in about 2 hours.

The NXT Speed Detailer will enhance the wax that's on your vehicle in the washings after you've waxed and it does an incredible job of doing that as the shine I've gotten from this detailer is better then any of the other meguiar's detailers i've used. The shine lasts for at least a week and it gleams incredibly.  The best part is that you can apply this stuff on the entire vehicle in 20 minutes or less.  And there is some protection this product has kind of like the spray waxes, but you definitely want to full wax every 2-3 months.  Another great attribute of this product is that if you have light dirt or dust on your vehicle..say a day or two after you've washed...you can just spray your entire vehicle and wipe down with a microfiber towel to get that just washed, gleaming shine, right on the spot.And per Meguiar's they say you can use this on windows and tires as well...although I use other things for my windows and tires...I may just try this on them for fun.

I recently decided I had to do better taking care of my cars after I lost a paint job on one  . I bought a pocket hose  to make it easier to rinse my car off after driving on the dirt road when it is muddy . I was suprised how much pollen and dust got on it . I bought some of that ice spray wax  that is suppose to keep it from sticking . Nice product very easy to put on though I sometimes don't wipe it off well and then I get dust over night and I hate to rinse the car because i get water spots unless I spray wax which takes allot of bending and reaching . I  saw there was a super duster that was bigger and I almost held out for one of those but the cheapest I could find it was $30 and I wasn't sure I would like this or it would work . I finely bought this one  it is just fine for my Grand Marquis . It  takes the dust right off and it also removes the spay wax I miss and I kid you not water spots if you rub hard with it . I see nothing but shine with the coat of ice spray wax 470r . I am washing with maquires car wash made not to remove wax and  it takes me about 30 minutes to wash and wax the car broken up  in two or three periods . All these things are available here but sometimes cheaper local . I found the duster for $13 at K store . Thats where I found appreciation for the size and I am very happy and when I can find a Super Duster for  a better price like this week Pep Boys had them for $20 I will get one of them for my hi top van and cleaning in the house  . This one here is perfect for ceiling fans if you stand on a stool and spin it . Very nice product worth the money and if I wasn't at the store the premium would be cheaper then gas to get one . The only thing I don't like is it takes up room in the car or trunk but well worth the cost and  trouble . No problem with lint except had a few strands get caught on sharp edges of trim . Car looks great in just 5 minutes I can do the whole thing . No problem across the hood , roof or trunk  I have 34 inch arms and am 6 foot though . If your worried check out the larger original super duster but I am glad I bought this one due to the storage room .

Southern", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "This is a great quick dusting tool if you are like me and try to take care of the paint on your car.I do a quick dusting with this before covering up the car at night. I use a CalCar Cover (Noah) to reduce sun damage and do a quick wipe to remove dust from the day before pulling the cover over. This will help reduce scratches in the clear coat and paint. These dusters are good when pollen is in the air too, but I would recommend being careful not to try and wipe down too much pollen. The yarn on this duster is soaked in wax so things will stick to them. Although they say to shake out the brush after wiping down the car, I wouldn't want to overload the duster and risk scratches down the road. These dusters last a long time, and are effective even when they've got a few years of dirt/dust on them, so maybe I'm being a little over cautious. However, I've been using my original duster for 13 years and just got a second, new one, this past month. The new dusters are a little lower in quality, seeming to have less yarn and are a little lighter, but they appear to be just as effective as the older ones. They come with a plastic sleeve to store it in, which is very handy to keep the duster from getting messed up when not in use.Be aware the duster needs to be &#34;seasoned&#34; after purchasing. This means that the first few times you use it you may get some streaks from the wax on your paint. The wax comes off easily with a microfiber cloth. This wax streaking will stop after the first few uses.Also you should NEVER use it on a hot surface (like a car left in the sun or on a hot hood/engine cover after driving). Wipe the dust off in the shade or in the evening and after the engine has had time to cool off.Finally, don't use this to replace washing your vehicle. If you have a clean car to start with then this will help keep it clean/dust free longer. It's only designed to take off a light layer of dust on the paint and glass surfaces. This dust will usually collect on the flat horizontal areas, so that and the top edges are the places you'll most frequently use it. Use care and try to avoid wiping behind the wheels where road dirt kicks up. You don't want this duster getting tar and other oily grime on it. I can't say how good it is with beach/sand dust since that's a lot sharper/more damaging and heavier. Maybe other reviewers have commented on that elsewhere.I'd also recommend the mini duster (search Amazon for California mini duster).

Misuse of these items can seriously injure and kill people, as well as do major damage to vehicles.

But, if you don't have that luxury at least buy a receiver CLEVIS mount with a closed eye and a screw-pin clevis.Other safety advice from experts:Only use a soft nylon tow strap rated at least twice your vehicle's weight.Never use a strap with built-in hooks or metal eyelets.Never use chain.Never use wire rope cable.I knew the dangers when I bought it.

{"reviewerID": "AC6Z7DP1Z5GHD", "asin": "B000AA4RWM", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of the better levels.", "unixReviewTime": 1405296000, "reviewTime": "07 14, 2014"}

I recently purchased these for a second time, as the originals were sold with my previous trailer and I wanted to make my new trailer easier to get on a level stance.There really isn't much to go wrong as far as product failure is concerned.  Accuracy is up to you with the initial installation.Recommended method of installation is to get your trailer level/RV, front to back, and side to side.  Once you have your trailer true, install the graduated levels in locations which will show you front to back level (placed on the side of the trailer) and side to side (place on the front or back of the trailer).  Make sure the bubble indicates \"level\" by being in the center point of the tube.Installation should be done once all your components are \"stressed\" as they will be for trailer/RV use (I.E. front tongue on a travel trailer, all the normal weight sitting on the winch foot, or in the case of 5th wheels/motorcoaches, landing gear down), try to place the levels on the RV in clear view of the winch/landing gear controls to enable leveling without having to relocate to a different location to view the levels.I accomplished this on a travel trailer by placing one level on the very front center, and the other on the side of the frame tongue close to the winch.  Though small, with sharp eye-sight, you can take advantage of the one on the front of the trailer as you position the trailer to see if you can establish a level side to side stance as you near your desired location.On my 5th wheel, my landing gear controls are on the front corner of the main body.  I placed one on the side of the rig for front to back level, and another right around the corner on the front side (for side to side level) still within sight of the controls, as well as from the truck cab for backing up.  Even though the level is off center, if it is installed properly with the trailer level at the time of installation, it will work fine.As far as the graduated scales are concerned, you will have to find your \"scale\" for adjustments, as it depends on where the levels are placed in reference to the center of the pivot points.The levels come with a self adhesive foam strip on the back for placement as well as two holes for screws if you wish to drill holes in the side of your rig.  I go with the adhesive strip route, as I don't like unnecessary holes.  The only negative with the adhesive strips is they will flex if stressed and it can put the levels off level, though this only happened to me with the first pair after the foam tape aged a few years.One last comment . . .the green bubble tube will fade from extended UV exposure.  It will not interfere with the accuracy, just makes it a little harder to read.If you are looking for larger levels which can be read from a distance, I know they are out there, but I have no experience with them to make a comparison.  I do not wish to clutter the appearance of the rig with large levels.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good Value", "unixReviewTime": 1288137600, "reviewTime": "10 27, 2010"}

So I'll do those later when I use them because the Chrysler 300C I got still has a HEMI and the NGK plugs fit it. So I'll get to that later and make my without use comments here as it applies here. I bought this Permatex Anti-Seize solely for use with the HEMI's unique shaped spark plugs to prevent later problems. Luckily before I ever got to installation, I wanted to confirm the torque on the NGK plugs and in a Goggle search, I happened upon a NGK technical bulletin. This may or may not apply top the plugs you plan to install but NGK specifically stated in the bulletin to NOT use any type of anti-seize lubricant. They indicated that all NGK plugs already come with a electronically applied coating to act as an anti-seize and when individual's then also add an external anti-seize, it greatly increases the probability of over torqueing the spark plugs ending in failure. The pictures actually showed the threaded portion breaking in half. Not so bad for just the plug but if part of that drops into your cylinder and gets bounced around by the piston, you may be looking at a much bigger expense to fix your engine! So check you plug manufacture before you purchase for plugs. Back to this actual material, I can still use it on other items no issues but the four stars and title come form the fact that the end of the lid mounted applicator brush looked like somebody had ground it into a counter top to make a big puff ball so if you want anything like clean application and you get a applicator like I did, you're going to need a separate applicator on your own.

{"reviewerID": "AN81JUYW2SL24", "asin": "B000AAMY86", "reviewerName": "Gearhead Mania", "helpful": [171, 195], "reviewText": "The installation of the SG2 is simple: attach the OBD2 connector to the DLC port and attach the RJ-45 jack to the SG2 unit. Routing the cable is really up to the operator. I chose to do it in a crude manner because I don't plan to make it a permanent addition to the car. I zip tied the cable to my HVAC vents and anchored it to the empty traction control hole behind the glove box.I used 1 of the provided velcro kits to affix the SG2 to the top of my steering column so that it is right below the instrument panel. It actually blocks my view of the shift indicator array, although I can still see it clearly if I lean forward.The update rate set at FAST is still rather slow and that is to be expected with the outdated OBD-II network. The \"fastest\" aftermarket scan tool that I have seen is SCT's Live Link for Ford / GM / Chryslers. If you want anything faster, you are going to have to borrow an OEM's scan tool system.The X-Gauge interface is a bit cumbersome since you are restricted to using 2 buttons to enter alphanumeric characters while if you pause for anything more than 10-15 seconds, the SG2 shuts down. According to Linear Logic, they are working on an updated SG2 with datalogging features so hopefully they incorporate a PC interface to speed up programming and setup times.I have it set to monitor instantaneous MPG, RPM, Vehicle Speed, and a gauge that I frequently switch depending on my mood. I am monitoring the torque converter slip ratio. Whenever it reads below 1.00, it means the torque converter is \"slipping\". Above 1.00 means the output side of the converter is spinning faster than the input side and theoretically it could just mean engine braking with some torque converter slip. You can program custom X-Gauges to monitor gross engine horsepower or torque input at the transmission.I had previously used a Garmin Forerunner 101 to check my GPS vehicle speed and compared it to my speedometer readout (2000 Ford Crown Vic with mechanical speedometer). It revealed that my GPS speed was about 2-3 mph slower than the speedometer indicated speed. The SG2's vehicle speed readout (from the Vehicle Speed Sensor PID in the OBD-2 system) is approximately 2-3 mph slower than the speedometer reading and I am assuming this is the same readout as my GPS (I didn't get a chance to verify this yet).Some of the gauges I like to monitor are Coolant Temperature, Intake Air Temperature, Transmission Fluid Temperature (XGauge), Torque Converter Slip Ratio (XGauge), Gross Horsepower (XGauge), RPM, Vehicle Speed, and MPG.I still haven't been able to figure out how to work the trip computer properly to display averaged fuel economy. The instantaneous MPG is more important to me because I want to see if anything is not working right on long cruises. I have often wondered if the torque converter was locking properly when I use cruise control or when cruising on the highway.The data collection stability is impressive. I never ran into many problems with Car Code or SCT's Live Link, but SG2 is just more convenient and compact. The backlight colors are interesting as they allow you to choose 4 different values of each RGB component (or 64 possible combinations). I have it set to R=3, B=0, G=0 so that it resembles Pontiac's interior lighting (I drive a Ford).My only real complaint is that there's not a better way of attaching the SG2 to the car. A suction cup mount for the windshield would come in handy since I could mount it near my line of sight without relying on adhesive-backed velcro. The interface is quite intuitive but I would have liked a way to program the X-gauge more easily, like via a PC interface.Bottom line: The SG2 is a great deal if you are interested in data readouts for your car. There are cheaper ways of pulling DTC codes, so the only real usefulness of SG2 is the \"realtime\" PID monitoring and the trip computer for cars that do not have such devices. If you know someone who is a bona fide gearhead and drives a car made in 1996 or newer, they may appreciate the SG2 as a gift.UPDATE:While the ScanGauge II provided a useful feature for cars without trip computers or onboard monitoring for various PIDs, I have noticed that it began to malfunction more frequently. The gauge readouts began to \"flicker\" between PIDs. For example, monitoring IGNition, the IGN began to switch rapidly between HPR. Just recently, the entire ScanGauge II shutdown while I was driving. It would refuse to reconnect with the OBD2 network. When it did find a connection, a lot of the text was garbled and it lost all of my trip data except for the total mileage. My car normally maxes out on 300 miles per tank of gasoline, so I was bewildered when the SG2 said I drove over 4000 miles. Other SG2 readers have reported similar quirks, albeit not as serious as the self shutdown and data corruption that I experienced.Many newer cars already have features built-into the car. The Pontiac G8, and Nissan GT-R are two examples of cars that have very developed \"trip computers\" while many other modern vehicles like the Pontiac G6, have trip computers that can monitor most of the fuel-related data.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "High Utility Factor, Intuitive Interface, but has bugs and issues", "unixReviewTime": 1202342400, "reviewTime": "02 7, 2008"}

I sometimes have had the ScanGauge II display Cost which shows in real time what it is costing me to drive minute by minute. Consequently we leave the 4Runner parked and covered from the sun for long periods, usually about a week at a time, while we drive the Prius everywhere.It always shocks me when I fill the 4Runner and put in 15 gallons or so into the 24 gallon tank which costs me about $60 and I've only driven about 200 miles. Then I compare that to the Prius in which we regularly get about 48 mpg and put in about 6 gallons having driven about 288 miles for a cost of about $24.So in the long run this ScanGauge II has paid for itself, not by teaching me any ways to save gas while driving the 4Runner, but rather by not driving it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Its great but it hasn't saved me any gas.", "unixReviewTime": 1354838400, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2012"}

The forum suggested to their members thatScanGauge IIwould be the ideal choice to monitor the Motor Electronics Coolant Temp (MeC) and HV Battery temperature (Traction Battery Temp).I am pleased to inform that this tool can be configured with Ford Specific XGauges (See comments) to achieve that feat pretty easily. Ford Escape Hybrid (With Navigation) does have host of other real-time display like HV battery SOC real-time MPG on the dash but FORD hides most of the stuff from user which are needed to troubleshoot common check engine light errors and in my case why my FORD escape Hybrid sometimes decides not to turn off the Internal combustion engine (ICE) and keeps running the Radiator FANs when it should not. It baffled me for couple of weeks and led me to investigate the issue further.After setting this tool up and monitoring it for several days I could see a pattern that there are two main reason why the ICE would not shut down at idle or at a stop light. They were primarily due to 'over-temp' condition of the Motor Electronics Coolant temperature caused by a weak MCE coolant pump in conjunction with the HV battery Traction battery temperature.Replacing the nearly failed original 2006 Motor electronics Coolant Pump at 98,XXX miles (FORD OEM PART number 5M6Z-8C419-A) It did help in cooling the Motor electronics coolant temperature a little bit however the traction battery FANS are still an issue which I am continuing to investigate using this Automotive computer Gauge.FYI, There is a disturbing trend in these line of 2005-2007 FORD Escape hybrid vehicles that calls for Air-Conditioning compressor to turn ON as soon as the HV battery temp reaches 95 to 96.8 F to cool the battery using the rear air-conditioning contraption by opening the blend door and what not but as your car ages the Internal two fans housed inside the HV battery tends to fail slowly (without actually flagging any DTC codes) and thereby no matter how much AC compressor works hard (Only with ICE running) it cannot cool the HV battery enough to go under 94F for the ICE to stop at idle or at a STOP sign.It is winter here in California and thanks for mother nature my HV battery rarely calls for cooling for most of the stop and go traffic and I still have not ventured to replace the two Internal HV battery FANs (FORD OEM PART 5M6Z-10C659-A) on my Ford Escape Hybrid but I do closely monitor the temperatures using this valuable tool.Bottom line: An excellent tool to have for any gasoline or diesel engines for real-time MPG and RPM readings as well as read understand and clear (Check Engine Light) DTC codes. Well worth the price as it pay for itself in less than a year if you come across a check engine light and could decode yourself and clear it. Or just by using this tool to carefully change your driving habits and improving the gas mileage.I am amazed how crazy some drivers are who accelerate hard cut in front of you, overtake you just to stop in front of you at a STOP Light. Did you know how much Gas you could save just by decelerating slowly and watch for the traffic pattern ahead of you? - You can save nearly 30% of your gas tank not to mention less wear and tear of you brakes and other stuff when you learn to drive less aggressively.Drive safe!, Drive intelligently and save on gas!Cheers!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Valuable Tool to have!", "unixReviewTime": 1357257600, "reviewTime": "01 4, 2013"}

It is adaptable to most vehicles (visit Scangauge's website to be sure yours is on the list). Interestingly, it interfaces via an ethernet port. I used it on a Ford Taurus, A Mercury Grand Marquis, and a Dodge Caravan. Yes, it displays real time MPG data. It also gives you the average time weighted average MPG. RPM, MPH,and TPS data- no problem. Coolant temperature, Ditto. Manifold absolute pressure depends on the vehicle. Same with intake air temperature. It does not give the actual O2 sensor reading, only if the loop is closed or open. It will definitely teach you skills to improve your fuel economy. Surprisingly, the larger your engine the better you will do because you can take advantage of low rpm high torque situations. I got 29.1 MPG with my Grand Mark using it (Averaged over 65 miles in city, highway and country backroads passing Amish Buggies) Philadelphia to Lancaster, PA. I would have given it 5 stars but the materials it is made with are lightweight and I'm not sure if it will stand the test of time. It is a very useful gadget, and it is a shame we can't hook it up to a laptop to send the data to the state DOT to pass emissions inspection. I suggest ScanGauge look into this, it would probably only take a software upgrade, I know the hardware is up to task. I also suggest they encase it in shockproof rubber to protect it.This is a follow up review  5000 miles out from the last review. I revised the unit to 5 stars. Its durability has proven the test of time and jockeying between 3 vehicles. It sits nicely above the wheel of my V8 Grand Marquis with no significant dash obstruction. It maves easily from vehicle to vehicle an is capable of taking a hit bere or there. It would still be nice to have a shockproof rubber case but I upped my rating to 5 stars both because it held up well and it helped me average between 24-28 MPG country in my Grand Mark. It paid for itself in gasoline already. Anything more is gravy now. The only thing I suggest is a list of OBD codes to go with the unit. It is no longer as easy to find them using google because the mechanics and auto makers want to keep this information proprietary. Google OBD and the first 50 entries are either discussion boards, parts suppliers, or sensor makers. The same happens when you seek out a specific code. You have to dig but you can find what they mean.

I have used different devices to keep my trailers from moving over the years. With tandem wheels the best way seems to put a spreader style lock between the tires.

They were the style that you adjusted them, then placed them between the tires and pulled a lever up while trying to keep the bottom from coming up, I did this with an old wrench holding the bottom down. With two bad shoulders this was getting to be a dreadful experience. Finally they were just too rusted and I just couldn't keep them adjusted.I have had my eye on this style for a while but thought they were expensive. Well I finally took the leap and I am happy I did. They are easy to put between the tires and crank them tight. My trailer is more stable now than ever before. I did buy two of them and a wrench came with each so I have a spare. The box wrench has two different sizes, one on each end. It is also a ratcheting wrench. So I marked the end that fits the device and also marked the wrench for which side to be up to put them on and which side to be up to take them off. This set up is so much easier! Suppose you could buy the cheaper set but I like the way these press and fit on the tires.Wish I would of bought these sooner.Update: We have used these on several trips now.

See also Fantasea Silicon Grease Lubricant, \"for all types of O-Rings\"Although ordinary automotive grease is very damaging to rubber products, silicon grease is great for ANY rubber products, and for use on ANY electronic connection (other than high-voltage switches). Not only does silicon grease prevent corrosion at electrical contacts, it also improves existing contacts.THE DREADED BLUE SCREEN OF DEATHAfter about 5 years of flawless operation, recently I got a \"blue screen of death\" on my computer, mentioning a parity-check error. Attempts to restart the computer just brought up the same \"blue screen of death\"---I could not even get to the minimal Windows configuration for trouble-shooting. I removed the memory boards, cleaned the contacts with isopropyl alcohol, applied a thin layer of silicon grease to the contacts on the memory boards, and reinstalled the memory. Since then (a year ago), the computer works perfectly.More recently my other (ca 10-year-old) computer has been getting progressively flakier for about 5 years---if I opened and closed several demanding applications and/or surfed the web extensively---a lockup or crash was likely---so I routinely rebooted several times a day to avoid the lockups/crashes. Occasionally, even freshly booted up, I could not access certain files or folders (the only solution was to clear the recycle bin, delete the file or folder, and then restore it from the recycle bin). Running registry repair programs and other diagnostics did not help. Completely reformatting the harddrive and reinstalling Windows and all my programs from scratch did not help. A new harddrive did not help. About once a month, the computer crashed with a parity-check error message---which began me thinking that I might have a similar problem with the memory board contacts. So during my last annual \"spring cleaning\" of the inside of the computer (particularly the CPU cooler), I also made a point of pulling the memory boards one-at-a-time (blowing any dust out of the contacts with canned air), applying silicon grease to the contacts, and reinstalling the memory boards. Since then (3 months ago) the computer has been working like new. REALLY!It would be a good idea to coat the contacts of any boards or memory with silicon grease before installing.EXAMPLES OF AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRIC USESDoes your car refuse too start when it's been raining for days? You could replace the entire ignition harness (for perhaps $100 plus labor)---or just coat the wires with silicon grease, being particular generous at the spark plug and distributor connections. No need to wipe off excess. Also pull off the spark plug wires (one at a time so you don't confuse them) and put a dollop of grease on the contacts.Replacing your car battery? This stuff is far better than the petroleum jelly your father used to protect the contacts from corrosion.EXAMPLES OF PLUMBING USESIs your bathroom faucet leaking? Disassemble it, clean it, and rub silicon grease into all of the rubber seals. Let it set, wipe off excess, reassemble. Does your toilet run on and on after you flush it? Same solution.EXAMPLES OF USES AS A LUBRICANTIs the A/C plug for your juicer hard to push into the socket? Add a generous coating of silicon grease and stick it in and out of the socket several times to lubricate the socket. Petroleum-based grease or oil may conduct electricity and burn---making the connection worse. Silicon grease will not conduct electricity nor burn.Is the door lock of your car stiff? Same solution, slather silicon grease on the key, and lock/unlock the door several times.IMPROVING ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONSDoes the right or left channel of your headphones drop out or sputter? Silicon grease will improve the connection.Do you have to shake your TV remote to make it work? Silicon grease will improve the batteries connections.Have you noticed? 40 years ago leaking battereies destroyed uncountable flashlights and transistor radios. Everyone knew that you had to remove batteries when not in use. But then batteries improved in the 1980s and 1990s and almost never leaked. But once again, batteries are leaking and damaging equipment. Silicon grease will at least protect your contacts from minor leaks, and will improve already damaged contacts.RECONDITIONING RUBBER PRODUCTSDoes wind noise at high speed because of a poor door seal drive you crazy? Coat the seal with silicon grease. Rub it in, let it set, wipe off excessDo you have a classic car with stiff dried-out rubber seals? This stuff is first aid. If they aren't too dead, silicon grease will bring them back to life, and protect them from further deterioration.Sliding windows in your van hard to open/close? Coat the channels with silicon grease.Within reason, you cannot use too much. Unlike ordinary oil and grease silicon grease does not attract dirt.CAUTIONSilicon grease is NOT a replacement for petroleum-based grease as a lubricant for continuously moving mechanical parts. While silicon grease can \"recondition\" rubber belts and rollers (in computer printers, etc) it can also make them too slippery to do their job (instead use CaiKleenTM RBR Liquid, oiler dispenser concentrate 25 mL). Silicon grease can interfere with repainting cars---so it is best to avoid getting silicon grease on painted surfaces, particularly if you anticipate repainting the surfaces in the near future. In high-voltage switches, arcing can create silicon carbide which will deteriorate the contacts.To see my\"How to Repair electronic devices damaged by bad batteries\",\"How to Improve Rubber Seals or Revitalize Rubber Items\", and\"How to Improve electrical connections\" guides,click on \"See all my reviews\" above, then click on \"So you'd like to know\" guides on the left side of the page", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Super Secret For Electronics, Rubber, and More", "unixReviewTime": 1296604800, "reviewTime": "02 2, 2011"}

{"reviewerID": "AI0BCEWRE04G0", "asin": "B000AL8VD2", "reviewerName": "Stoney", "helpful": [183, 195], "reviewText": "Although usually sold for automobile bulb sockets (for which it works great), this product is actually silicon grease.  \"Dielectric\" means that the silicon grease is an electronic insulator.Although ordinary automotive grease is very damaging to rubber products, silicon grease is great for ANY rubber products, and for use on ANY electronic connection (other than high-voltage switches).  Not only does silicon grease prevent corrosion at electrical contacts, it also improves existing contacts.THE DREADED BLUE SCREEN OF DEATHAfter about 5 years of flawless operation, my wife got a \"blue screen of death\" on her computer, mentioning a parity-check error.  Attempts to restart the computer just brought up the same \"blue screen of death\"---I could not even get to the minimal Windows configuration for trouble-shooting.  I removed the memory boards, cleaned the contacts with isopropyl alcohol, applied a thin layer of silicon grease to the contacts on the memory boards, and reinstalled the memory. Since then (5 years ago as of 2014), the computer has worked perfectly.As of February 2011 my (ca 10-year-old) computer had been getting progressively flakier for about 5 years---if I opened and closed several demanding applications and/or surfed the web extensively---a lockup or crash was likely---so I routinely rebooted several times a day to avoid the lockups/crashes.  Occasionally, even freshly booted up, I could not access certain files or folders (the weird solution was to move the file or folder to some other location---then it could be opened, and moved back if desired). Running registry repair programs and other diagnostics did not help.  Completely reformatting the harddrive and reinstalling Windows and all my programs from scratch did not help.  A new harddrive did not help. Cleaning usually improved stability, but only for a few weeks.  About once a month, the computer crashed with a parity-check error message---which began me thinking that I might have a similar problem with the memory board contacts.  So during a semiannual cleaning of the inside of the computer I applied a very thin layer of silicon grease to the contacts.  Until I replaced the computer three years later, it had been working like new.  REALLY!OBJECTIONS BY \"EXPERTS\"A number of self-appointed computer \"experts\" have written-in to violently object to the use of silicon grease on computer memory boards---without actually paying any attention to my explanations of why it does work.  Yes, most of the time a simple cleaning (including blowing out the dust with canned air, pulling the boards, wiping the contacts with a clean cotton cloth and reinserting them) will solve most memory-related computer problems. But---thanks to the Feds---modern \"canned air\" is actually liquid CO2. Be VERY careful to keep the can fully upright so you are spraying only \"air\".  If you tilt the can (even slightly when full) you'll get liquid CO2 which can crack (and destroy) computer components (and killed my old computer).  If cleaning doesn't work, and your computer is over 3 years old, the expense of ANY repair is likely to exceed the value of your computer.  In that case, it would seem foolish (to me at least) not to try the silicon grease.EXAMPLES OF AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRIC USESDoes your car refuse too start when it's been raining for days?  You could replace the entire ignition harness (for perhaps $100 plus labor)---or just coat the wires with silicon grease, being particular generous at the spark plug and distributor connections.  No need to wipe off excess.  Also pull off the spark plug wires (one at a time so you don't confuse them) and put a dollop of grease on the contacts.Replacing your car battery?  This stuff is far better than the petroleum jelly your father used to protect the contacts from corrosion.Replacing turn-signal or other light bulbs?  Generously coat the contacts with silicon grease---this is actually the primary application of automotive dielectric grease.EXAMPLES OF PLUMBING USESIs your bathroom faucet leaking?  Disassemble it, clean it, and rub silicon grease into all of the rubber seals.  Let it set, wipe off excess, reassemble.  Does your toilet run on and on after you flush it?  Same solution.EXAMPLES OF USES AS A LUBRICANTIs the A/C plug for your juicer hard to push into the socket?  Add a generous coating of silicon grease and stick it in and out of the socket several times to lubricate the socket.  Petroleum-based grease or oil may conduct electricity and burn---making the connection worse.  Silicon grease will not conduct electricity nor burn.Is the door lock of your car stiff?  Same solution, slather silicon grease on the key, and lock/unlock the door several times.IMPROVING ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONSDoes the right or left channel of your headphones drop out or sputter?  Silicon grease will improve the connection.Do you have to shake your TV remote to make it work? Silicon grease will improve the batteries connections.Have you noticed?  40 years ago leaking batteries destroyed uncountable flashlights and transistor radios.  Everyone knew that you had to remove batteries when not in use.  But then batteries improved in the 1980s and 1990s and almost never leaked.  But once again, (Chinese manufactured) batteries are leaking and damaging equipment.  Silicon grease will at least protect your contacts from minor leaks, and will improve already damaged contacts.RECONDITIONING RUBBER PRODUCTSDoes wind noise at high speed because of a poor door seal drive you crazy?  Coat the seal with silicon grease.  Rub it in, let it set, wipe off excessDo you have a classic car with stiff dried-out rubber seals?  This stuff is first aid.  If they aren't too dead, silicon grease will bring them back to life, and protect them from further deterioration.Sliding windows in your van hard to open/close?  Coat the channels with silicon grease.Within reason, you cannot use too much.  Unlike ordinary oil and grease silicon grease does not attract dirt.CAUTIONSilicon grease is NOT a replacement for petroleum-based grease as a lubricant for continuously moving mechanical parts.  While silicon grease can \"recondition\" rubber belts and rollers (in computer printers, etc) it can also make them too slippery to do their job (instead useCaiKleenTM RBR Liquid, oiler dispenser concentrate 25 mL). Silicon grease can interfere with repainting cars---so it is best to avoid getting silicon grease on painted surfaces, particularly if you anticipate repainting the surfaces in the near future.  In high-voltage switches, arcing can create silicon carbide which will deteriorate the contacts.To see my\"How to Repair electronic devices damaged by bad batteries\",\"How to Improve Rubber Seals or Revitalize Rubber Items\", and\"How to Improve electrical connections\" guides,click on \"See all my reviews\" above, then click on \"So you'd like to know\" guides on the left side of the page", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Super Secret for electronics and rubber products", "unixReviewTime": 1296604800, "reviewTime": "02 2, 2011"}

I bought two of these, and in about 20 minutes, the problem was solved. They have been installed for about a month, and seem to be working just fine.Installation was easy. The old struts were held by two bolts on each strut. Once they were removed, the new ones popped could be screwed in. You may have to hold the tailgate as far open as possible to install the strut.A couple tips from the installation:1. Get a helper. Much easier if someone holds up the tailgate while you are trying to replace these.2. You will need a Torx bit- not sure of the size, but it was the largest one in my kit.3. The existing bolts are on pretty tight. A drop of penetrating oil on the screw made it easier to remove the bolts.4. My Torx kit only had a cheap \"screwdriver\" handle to hold the Torx bits. I ended up destroying this handle because the existing screws were in so tight. It is probably worth buying a ratchet wrench setup before you start.5. One tip- when installing the new strut, it helps if you snug up the upper screw first. This slightly lifts the strut, making it easier to line up the bottom screw.Hope that helps. The whole process was actually pretty easy- if you can use a socket wrench, you can do this.UPDATE: 9/9/13After 7 months of relatively light use (I open the tailgate roughly 3 times per week), my opinion of these has gone from 5 to 1 star. They still work, but they make so much noise I am ashamed to open my tailgate within 100 yards of people. Opening or closing the gate will result in a very loud screech from both struts. Not an annoying little squeak, but a very lout, annoying, nails-on-a-chalkboard screech.I have tried a film of oil, silicon spray and creative language, but nothing will remove the screech.I finally tracked down the StrongArm supplier, AVM industries and left an email message on their customer service website.Update 9/24/13I guess after 2 weeks, they have no intention of replying to their emails. I called their tech support number 800-790-5438. No answer, but left message.Update 9/25/13Another phone call, another message.

For a DIY'er with a house, workshop, vehicles, tractors and mowers, the uses are endless.  I keep a supply of both the industrial size as well as the smaller size on hand.  However, there is one BIG secret:PREPARATION!If the joining surface of the material to be fused is not prepared correctly, it will NOT work.First, the surfaces must be roughed up a bit. On steel, iron, aluminum or any metal, I use a course grinding wheel if possible.  A file works fine if you have a supply of elbow grease.  My favorite method on small surfaces is using a tungsten carbide cutter bit with a Dremel.Second, clean the surface thoroughly with acetone.  Do not use alcohol.Acetone evaporates in a very few seconds.Once the surface is dry, apply J-B Weld and allow it to cure. Repairing cracks is a breeze.  If I have a broken item in two parts, I rig some sort of jig to keep pressure on the joint while it cures.With J-B Weld, Liquid Nails, Acetone and fiberglass cloth, there are not too many things that can't be repaired.I had a concrete fountain bowl that weighed over 200 pounds in the front yard.  Weather extremes and age caused it to break in half on the pedestal.  My failure to keep the drainage holes clean in winter might have had something to do with it.  I cleaned it up, propped up one half on its side, covered both halves thoroughly and liberally J-B Weld and placed the halves together.  I allowed them to sit there and cure for a week.  I then covered both sides with a thick layer of exterior construction Liquid Nails and allowed it to dry another week before placing the heavy bowl back on the pedestal. That was over a year ago.  The repaired joint will last longer than the original concrete.If you are so inclined, you can mix up a thin mixture of J-B Weld with acetone so it will completely saturate a piece of fiberglass cloth and repair a 6-foot crowbar.Repairs are only limited by one's imagination.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "J-B WELD HELD WELL", "unixReviewTime": 1305504000, "reviewTime": "05 16, 2011"}

I'm an avid lover of Amazon and its low prices. These were more expensive here on Amazon but if you want to avoid a trip to the automotive store or you don't have an automotive store these'll come to your door although the automotive store has the database that tells you what vehicle it fits (would be great if amazon had a similar database - hint hint).Bear in mind, these bulbs fit dozens of vehicles but you need to know the part number that you need before you order.  Also, installation difficulty also varies by vehicle.  I'm handy around vehicles and have tools so it was a pinch for me, but if you're not mechanically inclined you might just want to opt for having these replaced at a dealer.It's a five dollar job if you know what you're doing.LED CHOICES:A few things on LED lights out there.  LED lights have come a long way but by and large its hard to find an LED light that does the job these bulbs do although LEDs should last forever.  The other thing about LEDs is that they draw very little power and that can cause some problems in your vehicle.  Example, the way I knew my brake light (blinker light) was broken was that when I turned on the blinker it flashed really fast (flash flash flash flash vs flash pause flash pause flash pause)...because LEDs draw so little power, your car thinks you have a broken flash light so your blinkers could flash fast (alerting you that your blinker light is out)...some of the newer LED lights have a capacitor built in to prevent his behavior but bottom line, its hard to tell what you're getting.  I'll tell you, as soon as I find an LED light that is as bright as these bulbs, doesn't have the issues of fast flashing, and has bright lights - I will most definitely buy them primarily because LEDs should last longer than my car.  The other thing about LEDs is that they're expensive.  Bottom line, if you know what you're doing LEDs are a good option if you go find the right ones.  If you don't know your way around these newest products, go with these regular bulbsPREMIUM BULBS:In my experience they're a waste of money unless you're a car afficionado and are going for a particular look.BRIGHTNESS OF THESE BULBS:Since they were the exact same bulb that came with my car from the factory, the look is exactly the same.

I used it and it really did almost last for a year. I would say maybe 6-8 months or so. That is pretty good and close to a year. Be sure that your car is as clean as possible, you may want to use a polish before using this, but you are probably lazy since you hate waxing your car, so you can use this right after your car is washed. If you want to do the once over on your paint, once a year, I would recommend the following: Wash your car using Meguiars Gold Class; it is an excellent shampoo and conditioner for your car. Clay bar your car. The clay bar is probably the easiest product to use. It is almost effortless. You mist a section 18&#34; x 18&#34; with a quick detailer (yes Meguiars has an excellent quick detailer), then you use the clay bar with medium pressure. Make about 10 passes. Then you lightly wipe dry. Your paint will be very slick and you should not feel any grit after using it. Do NOT drop the clay or you may scratch the heck out of your paint.You have to throw it out and use a fresh clay bar. After you have completed the entire car with the clay bar, you can then use a polish. Yes I know Nu finish states that it is a polish, but we will pretend it is a protectant. Use a polish (similar to Meguiars polish - yes I love Meguiars products and no I do not have stock in the company). Then you can apply the Nu finish. One reviewer said to dampen the applicator; that is probably a good idea. Do one section at a time. As with any &#34;protectant products&#34; if you use too much it will be difficult to remove. Since you are going to be doing this once every 6-8 months, take the extra time and effort to do it correctly. After the Nu finish, may I suggest that you use Meguiars NXT 2.0. It is a polymer sealant that works very well. In summary:  Wash, Clay Bar, Polish, Nu Finish, and the optional poly sealant. If you are very lazy you can do your car in 2 steps. Drive it through the expensive car wash, and then use the Nu Finish. Good luck.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It work very well", "unixReviewTime": 1389398400, "reviewTime": "01 11, 2014"}

I personally use turtle wax hard shell for my own vehicles, but i notice alot of people seem to carry over what their parents use on their vehicles and well I see that holds true for me (dad used turtle wax) and my girl (her parents used nu finish). So she wanted me to apply this to her vehicle and i must admit, its an excellent product and seems to last longer than the turtle wax hard shell i use. Gives a great shine and there is enough in the container to do her 2000 Lincoln, which is a pretty good sized vehicle, about 3-4 times.I also see alot of people applying this product incorrectly as with turtle wax, you folks got to apply this stuff in sections, let it haze (dry), then wax off. Most auto detailers recommend a 2x2 section, so if you go above that foot print of a section - yes expect it to be very hard to remove and it will also have 'flakes' due to the over dried, over application of the product. You don't have to use alot of this stuff to do a section at a time, matter fact thin layer on the application pad is better. A little goes a long way.Another thing people may mistake about this product, its not a polish as its name says, more of a sealant/protectant, because it doesn't have any kind of cutting like a traditional polish does, so it won't remove minor scratches and whatnot, but it will give your paint protection from the elements for atleast 6 months. I'd like to say this paste would probably provide longer protection if you treated it like the liquid, because the liquid version directions are different than the paste in the fact that on the liquid it says to do one coat, then 30 days later do another, never tried it with the paste version though and it doesn't say that on the paste version instructions either, which is fine by me - i'll simply do a coat on her car every 6 months and it stays pretty well protected.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great finish!", "unixReviewTime": 1391817600, "reviewTime": "02 8, 2014"}

It last WAY LONGER than all the high priced garbage that is out there. Only caveat. Unlike Nu-Finish liquid  (which I also like) you must only do ONE PART of your car at a time with the paste.

This leads to situations where you could overextend the capacity of these products.I'd like a very clear rating: 2,000lbs, 4,000lbs, 6,000lbs for each stand or ramp on Amazon so that I know how much weight I can safely put on it similar to what is found on jacks....a jack is not labeled as 6,000lbs if it can lift a 6,000GVW vehicle, 6,000lbs means that the jack can lift 6,000lbs!After all, I'm planning to get under these things!!!!On items like this where someone's life very literally depends on the labeling ---  it would be really really really nice (and a legal requirement) that the specifications on Amazon very clearly stated both the operating weight, maximium weight, and crush (failure) weight per each ramp/stand versus this GVW rating which is deceptive and just plain dangerous.I have very literally found people working underneath 8,000lbs trucks without the wheels using jack stands sold as \"2ton\" when in reality each jack stand was only rated at 1ton or 2,000lbs.....their comment back, \"this is a 2 ton stand and 8,000lbs GVW divided by 4 is 2,000lbs or 1ton, plenty of margin.\"  When in reality 6,000lbs are up front....3,000lb for each wheel  and each stand rated at only 2,000lbs....making their jack stand 150% overloaded! --- horrendously scary (all because marketing is so bad in this area).

Reason is having a clayed and polished paint finished will make sure the wax is working on a clean and even surface.  I then examined the paint and found it to be free of any defects.Collinite application. Typical hand application, with a foam applicator pad.  Right off the bat, I noticed Collinite was more difficult to apply then a typical liquid wax.I applied it to every panel on the truck.  As soon as I was finished applying the last panel I noticed the wax has a nice haze, dry but not chaulky. I then got a fresh clean microfiber towel.  I fold the towel into 4 even sqaures.  Removal was not terribly difficult, but not the easiest wax I've removed either.  I examined the car and it looked fantastic.  After 12 hours, I put a second coat of 476s on the truck.  Conventional detailing wisdom says you need to give a wax 12 hours for it to \"set up\" and \"cure\" on the paint.  The second layer was applied the following morning.Overall, I think Collinite is a very good product.  I think it lasts longer than the typical wax and even longer than most sealants.  I think it looks quite good on a properly prepared vehicle but might not be the best for your average Joe wanting to wax his car.The point being, Collinite is a pretty durable wax, but it is not the magic bullet the manufacturer makes it out to be (no LSP is).  Under the right conditions (garage queen), you can probably get 4-6 months out of this product, but you'll NEVER get 1 year if it is left out to the elements.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Collinite 476s - everyday elemnets", "unixReviewTime": 1352160000, "reviewTime": "11 6, 2012"}

It doesn't do this perfectly, but it does seem to have a slight effect.I use this all summer and run the engines dry before storing in the winter.  Before putting away for the winter I also use fogging oil (another great product) before storage.  These two simple steps have saved me from lots of expense and aggravation.Now for the note of caution: You need to carefully read the bottle and religiously follow the directions.  Sta-bil keeps fuel fresh for awhile, but not forever.  I believe--and I don't have the bottle right in front of me--that it will keep gas fresh for 3 or 4 months.  So you can't fill up a 5 gallon can, add Sta-bil, and use that for several years.  It just doesn't work that way.  Also, the Sta-bil jug itself has a limited shelf life.  It's good, once opened, for at most two years.  Again, if you're a homeowner who doesn't plow through gas it doesn't make sense to buy a huge bottle.  You're often better off buying smaller bottles.Overall, fantastic product that really works.

I was easily able to tell the difference. I first started using STA-BIL when I moved to the East Coast, leaving my Ford Explorer behind. The vehicle was in good condition but had 150k miles on the odometer, making me somewhat concerned about starting the vehicle when I returned and/or attempted to sell it. I gave STAB-BIL a try and was very pleased with its performance. In fact, it seems to work longer than the 3-6 months the manufacturer suggests. For nearly two years, I had the vehicle parked in my parents' driveway, much to their chagrin. If I recall, I only put 1-2 bottles in the tank the entire time. I never had a problem starting the vehicle. Ultimately, I was able to sell the Explorer because I had no problems starting and running the vehicle during my brief trips back home.By contrast, a relative has a 1992 Mazda Miata with 35k miles, which is only used in the summer. The owner did not use fuel stabilizer until I purchased it for her. The last time I helped this person get the car started after being stored for four months, it chugged and sputtered for nearly 30 minutes. I would not have felt comfortable driving such a vehicle as it would have been likely to stall. I finally purchased STA-BIL as a stocking stuffer for Christmas '08 and put it into the Miata's gas tank myself. From what I understand, it has worked well. However, the real test will come in Spring 2010. I fairly confident it will work given my experience with my Explorer. Now, I recommend STAB-BIL to family members who are storing lawn and snow removal equipment. Consider STA-BIL a cost effective insurance policy along with simple tips below.Other Storage Tips:Over-inflate the tires to prevent flat spotsStart the car or equipment periodically in the off-seasonGet an AC trickle charge or solar trickle starter for the batteryGet an oil change before storageConsider insect repellants and/or covering air intakes if pests are a problem", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Useful Product, Great for Hassle-Free Storage of Vehicles", "unixReviewTime": 1242518400, "reviewTime": "05 17, 2009"}

About the same time I began to notice a loss of power and rough idling in my 2005 Mustang GT. Strange coincidence? Nope...Our mechanics found no problems... they basically told us that Ethanol sucks. To be more exact, Ethanol sucks energy out of your car by generating lots of water vapor that condenses and turns into water inside your engine as the engine cools down. This then leads to all sorts of bad things happening inside your engine including rough idle, corrosion, reduced power and a failure to easily start.Ethanol is really just a form of alcohol produced from distilling plant matter, and that alcohol picked up other decades-old particulates in the gas tanks and fuel lines of the classic cars... moving all that old junk to fuel filters and engines, causing them to clog and seize. Alcohol also breaks down plastics and many rubbers, including those used in gas and oil lines & hoses of most lawn equipment and many older vehicles. What a mess.We belonged to a classic car club at the time and our club mechanics recommended a two pronged attack on Ethanol's detrimental effects: (a) regular use of STA-BIL to remove moisture from the tank & line while stabilizing the Ethanol in the tank to minimize further moisture production; and (b) periodic application of a fuel system cleaner like SeaFoam or BG44K (our choice, which I have used every three or four months since).Our mechanic recommended using the standard or marine versions of STA-BIL in our cars, noting that both worked but the marine version was stronger (but you do pay a bit more for it and it can be tough to find). We continue to use both types of STA-BIL to remove moisture and BG44K to clean the system and enhance performance, and both my Mustang and our 1930 Ford Model A seem to run much smoother.Thankfully, the EPA has now recognized that data actually shows ethanol is not as environmentally friendly as ethanol advocates claimed it would be (surprise, surprise... look who made money on that scheme). The EPA has now cut back Ethanol requirements starting 2014. Even if the EPA gets rid of the Ethanol requirement, STA-BIL and BG44K have proven their worth to us and we will continue using them from now on.If you have something similar going on and you know it is not a mechanical issue, give this stuff a try.

For those who don't wish to remember the recommended pressure, the gauge can be programmed to store settings for the rear and front tires or, you could store settings for 2 cars if the recommended pressure happens to be the same for both front and rear.

But I do 'really like' this item.Simply taking a pressure reading is easy enough: Power on, hold it in your hand with your thumb on the raised bumps on that little slope above the big round button and press it against the valve until it beeps a couple of seconds later.  The reading is very accurate and the display easy to read in any weather condition.  And once you set your target pressures in the unit you can see how well your reading matches your preferred pressure.  On these points alone, I give it four stars, but not five for the following reasons.- The gauge powers off only a moment after you take a reading, so you have to start it again and select front or rear for each tire.  There should be a way to set how many seconds before it shuts off.- I don't even remember what the biggest button on the gauge does, but both its placement and the way it's marked causes you to naturally think it's the power and reset button.  It's not.  If I have to guess, it's probably \"Enter\" for when you're setting it up with your target tire pressures--I don't remember.- Bottom button, don't remember.

It is a group III synthetic these days in this Country.  No longer a group IV oil made from P.A.O. base stocks.  But still highly refined (though processes such as hydrocracking) and one of the best things you can do to maintain your cars motor in good condition and prevent wear.  Though I would not take for granted that you can automatically go 15,000 miles between oil changes.  If you look at the fine print you will notice it says to observe your manufacturers warranty which will specify oil change intervals (you don't want some damage to be blamed on your not changing the oil at the proper intervals, whether that was the cause or not) and in general says to follow your manufacturers recommendations. There are also typically other qualifiers such as a mileage figure OR once a year. One will notice that there are almost always both a regular and \"severe duty\" change interval as well.  Many people will fall in to the severe duty schedule so check that to determine the proper change intervals for your vehicle. If one is going to go beyond a manufacturers recommendations after the warranty period hopefully they will have done some research to support such a decision. I would just point out that at the prices this oil is available at it most certainly is cheap protection for preventing wear on your cars engine.  Though the prices I see here are not the least expensive by a long shot.  It is regularly priced at $26.00 for a 5 quart jug at the big retail store that begins with \"Wal\".  Some auto parts stores like \"Azone\" will price match so you can get that same price there.  There are also regular sales or rebates on this and other oils which make it unreasonable to purchase it at higher prices since one can plan ahead for something like an oil change. Use the viscosity for your cars requirements and your climate which will also be defined in your owners manual. So getting this high quality oil does not have to be a huge expense, certainly do not go longer between intervals because of cost being a factor, simply purchase it at the low price and change it according to schedule, you can't go wrong there and may be providing yourself an extra cushion which is not necessarily bad either. Of course always recycle your used motor oil and filters, it is free to do at most auto parts stores.  Otherwise I have been using M1 for decades with zero issues of engine wear and I attribute that to careful maintenance with Mobil 1 and a high quality filter such as the Mobil I EP filters that use synthetic media.  High quality synthetic oil that can be purchased at very low prices quite easily in conjunction with a synthetic media filter is going to be a great way to treat your cars engine and a great value as well, this oil accomplishes just that.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of the best street car oils around", "unixReviewTime": 1331078400, "reviewTime": "03 7, 2012"}

I belong to a couple of car clubs and at tech sessions I have heard all of the reasons from experts on why a synthetic oil is better for an engine.  But it wasn't until I bought a new turbo charged Audi that I found out that the right oil is vital to the longevity of your engine and the all important turbo charger.Since I do my own oil changes, I always read the owner's manual for maintenance tips. Because my Audi was the first car I have ever owned with a turbo, I made sure to read the oil section carefully. Audi (and parent VW) are so big that they can specify the characteristics their engines require to oil manufacturers. Almost always, this spec is spelled out in the manual and Mobil 1 will place it right on the bottle (in my case, the spec is VW 502.00).Modern engines are very high tech with tight clearances and technology that delivers, compared to just a few years ago, superior performance. And yet they are relatively non-polluting. Also, they are engineered to deliver good fuel mileage. This oil makes it on all counts.I urge you to crack the owner's manual and look at what your car's manufacturer recommends in terms of viscosity (that's the 0W-40 part), what type of oil works best (e.g., synthetic or not) and the proper drain intervals.I always follow the first two recommendations (viscosity, type) and \"half\" the last (drain interval). For various reasons (many of which are not based on pure technical analysis) the drain intervals on new cars have extended way beyond what I consider prudent. Me, since I own, not lease, my cars, I always reduce their recommendations by cutting them at least in half.  That, however is my habit. Since I can do an oil change whenever I want - no appointment necessary - and the labor is free, it's really not that expensive.Buy the best oil filter you can find, warm the engine to get all of the dirty oil mixed together and the water evaporated and go change your oil!

The Bmw was filthy with dirt and some traces of salt from driving in the rain. I used a 2 bucket system, one rinse bucket and one wash bucket with 2 gallons of water to 1 oz of product as instructed. I did about 1/6 of the car at a time, drying each section I washed with a Cobra Waffle Towel, which worked wonderfully.  I dried both cars with one towel before the end of the day and only wrung it out a five times.My drying towel stayed pretty clean through the process other than a few small areas due to carelessness on my part, and it didn't scratch or mar the surface and dried streak free.  I'd advise using one towel per vehicle or drying in between. It also took to the washer well and didn't fray at all using a low heat dryer settings.  I'd highly recommend this to anyone that is serious about taking care of the finish on their car.I know some people say you should always blot dry and not use swiping motions, but from my experience that's only true if your using cotton, terry cloth or other types of fabric.  If you the car surface is clean and you wipe lightly on a well waxed car using a fine clean microfiber towel it will not scratch your clear coat.  While I believe that to be the case with terry cloth or cotton products using high quality microfiber protects your clear coat by trapping the small particles in the fabric and keeping them from being rubbed into the surface.  If your really that concerned, I advise you use a leaf blower to dry your car so it's not touched at all.  That's the safest way to dry it weather permitting.  But in my opinion, the only reason to justify spending the money on a quality towel such is this is to save time by wiping.  If your going to take the time to blot a car dry you may as well save some money and buy terry or cotton towels.

You can carry more gas, and a second battery / electrical system, but air is hard to find, and with \"service\" stations removing it from their offerings of yesteryear, you need to have your own air system.What impressed me most about this compressor was the attachment point to the valvestem.  It is threaded and screws on, forming a seal during refil.  This seal is exceptional - good enough that the guage mounted on the compressor itself is accurate to set your tire pressure at the other end of the hose.  If you are filling a big tire, it will take some time, so this lets you sit back and relax while the motor works.  My tire chucks for shop air all require constant finger pressure to ensure a seal - not having to get tire chuck thumb was a nice side benefit!As for portable inflation systems, I've grown tired of anything with a cigarette lighter plug as the power source.  It's limited to 10 AMPs which gives you roughly 130-140 watts of power.  740 would be a full horsepower.  This compressor under load can draw 30 amps at 13V, for 390 watts - more than a half horsepower.  To do that they use clipon cable back to the battery.  Because I carry a second battery I clip on to it for the juice to run this.  It will also work with your main starting battery if you don't have a backup elecrical source.In the box you will find a carrying bag as well as an octogonal shaped piece of plastic - thats the air input filter - you need to screw it onto the air inlet to protect the compressor.  Its a quality unit so it needs protection.When all is said and done you have a 1/2 hp 12VDC compressor that gives you the freedom to set your tire pressure when and where you want to.  With the fast fill rate it takes very little time to top off your tires, if you want to drop your pressure for sand offroad and then refill it later when you hit asphalt this is a small but valuable tool to have in your emergency kit.The unit has a well balanced carrying handle to take it between tires and is light weight enough to take with you everywhere.  While you can use your car's starting battery, a second battery will prevent you from draining your starting battery.  When done, start up and drive away.If you seriously go offroad consider a highjack lift to get you out of a bind, or else a hydraulic system with a portable cylinder fed from your engine's hydraulic pump (if yours is equipped with one) or a secondary hydraulic system powered by your secondary electrical system - with all this you will not be stuck for long!Finally maintaining your tire pressure at proper levels for your load optimizes your fuel efficiency - at $3+ / gallon for fuel these days your efforts will pay for themselves shortly.While I have a 240VAC compressor in my shop, this is the first honest 12VDC compressor that does not take forever to fill a tire.  With a half horsepower air cooled motor it does the job quite well.

For the more mechanically inclined, screwing down the black base is a better way to go.

I purchased my '10 RX8 in May 2010 with 16 miles on the clock and have been babying her ever since.  After a few goes at conventional oil to break in the engine, I switched over to the RP after some great suggestions by the rx8 community.  In doing so I took care to be very meticulous about my oil changes, performing them every 3000 miles, and saving samples to send to Blackstone labs just to make sure that the oil was doing a good job and that my engine was healthy.  I ran the RP 5w30 in the winter, and then ran their 10w40 in the summer and had absolutely no problems.  Once I changed out my first interval of the 10w40, I sent the samples over to BSL (~$40 total to sample both) to check the results.  Although the numbers were above average, the Viscosity numbers were a tad low .... not alarmingly low, but I expected them to be stable considering that this is a premium oil.  The guys over at BSL assured me that this was completely normal, and because my car only has 10k miles on it now, it could just be residuals from breakin/conventional oil use/some 5w30 that stayed in the sump when i put the 10w40.  In any case, I sent my reports over to the folks at RP just to have them take a look-see.  Within a few hours I got back a reply from the RP team pretty much confirming what the guys over at BSL said.  Along with that, they stated that they wanted to continue monitoring my use just to be 100% sure that their assumptions are correct.  They sent me free sample kits and told me to send them some samples when I do an oil change again.There aren't that many companies out there that A. produce a fantastic product, B. advertise without bogus claims, and most importantly C. stand by their product 100%.  If anything, this company got my respect and loyalty due to their immediate response and their handling of my concerns.  Now again, let me stress, my oil analysis numbers were fantastic and were exactly what was expected of a newer car...but just because I had concerns the folks at RP asked me to send them over more samples so they can run an analysis free of charge.I hope that helps most of you that are still on the fence about trying this product even though it has a fantastic quality reputation.

These jacks stands are very well made of heavy gauge aluminum with a hardened steel pin with a bearing lock for the height adjustment.

Another reviewer stated that his stand 'wobbled'. While it's possible that reviewers stand was defective, if the screw is threaded into the hole and tightened down firmly into the base, the stand won't wobble. On my SUV vehicle, the jack points are very close together, so the base of a tripod-style jack stand is too wide for use.  The narrow profile of these stands is perfect and allows me to slip the jack stand behind the jack and under the rear jack point. Once in position, remove the pin, adjust the height and reinsert the pin. I also don't care for the ratchet style jack stands, which have been known to fail.

I think some folks recieved a knock off and therefore you might need to varify items part number and maybe even UPC number before ordering anywere online. Make sure it says MAXSA on the package and you have the correct one.It is very easy to setup,I measured our car first. Our Infiniti from dash center {were I wanted laser} to the front bumper was about 6ft. I then measured in my garage were I wanted the cars dash to be when I parked witch came out to be approx 9-10 ft from front wall. Thats 6 FT + 3 to 4FT for mower and walking space in front of car.Mine ended up being located in front of my garage door opener so my cars about 3-4 feet in my garage door when it detects it. That way it will light up just before I get to parking location I chose and laser wont stop shining before I park like some reported.My door opener dont seem to interfere with sensor even though its located between door and laser. Its a good sensor IMO. I aimed the laser on the center of my dash using a long stick while car was parked and the way I have it as long as the light is on the dash area rather all the way forward,centered or on the the edge of the dash the cars clear and your parking is fine.Since my laser is just above the center of the dash area and points straight down on the dash area, it leaves about a foot in either direction front or rear for some error. It seems to work well like this. It took about 15 min total to setup.CAUTION: Wives/husbands may act like they dont need a garage laser and it was a stupid waste of money.

It is safe because it has been used for years in Chevron gasoline.  The highest concentration of it are in the premium grade.  There have been lots of studies done on Techron.  The only difference between a bottle of this and the Techron in the pump at the gas station is that the Techron in this bottle is a much higher concentration. The reviewer who said that Chevorn stations were disappearing did not know what he was talking about and as to his manual stating not to use additives that may or may not be the case but for Techron since it is in pump gas it makes no sense this product would be included.  It is designed to clean deposits in fuel injectors and carbs and to some degree help clean or prevent buildup of deposits on valves.  It may nor may not increase MPG, that is entirely dependent upon the issue you are having and how much a detergent added to your gas can clean. If your fuel injectors can have a better spray pattern then perhaps you could see minor increases in MPG.  It is more likely to help an engine run and idle smoother and have power closer to what it was new if the fuel system has become inefficient due to becoming dirty with deposits. In many instances it can help clean deposits to an extent where there is a noticeable improvement in how your engine idles because it has helped to unclog your fuel injectors.  Again it certainly is one product that will not in any event harm your engine. It also will very likely help keep those deposits from becoming an issue in the first place if used on occasion.  However this, like any other gas additive can only do so much. It is reasonable to try using it before moving on to a more expensive repair, but no gas additive can take the place of a mechanical cleaning or replacement or a fuel injector or repair of a damaged engine.  So if you are going to use a cleaning fuel additive this is one of the best and the safest to try.  Just remember there is no \"engine rebuild in a can\" and the bulk of products such as oil additive mask serious wear issues at best.  If you have relatively minor issues that could be helped by cleaning of the fuel delivery system this is one of the first easiest steps to take, along with changing fuel filters and any other maintenance that your car may need such as replacing spark plugs.  If this does not work there are machines at shops that are made for cleaning fuel injectors and related systems such as MotoVac which runs a cleaning fluid in a closed loop for a long period of time.  That is a step up from adding something to your tank. If that fails than a mechanical remedy is needed.  The only other two products I would consider using are made by Redline and Lucas.  They make good products in general and have had good reviews on their fuel system cleaners.  So feel safe trying this but don't expect miracles.  Proper engine maintenance is going to be your best and lowest cost way to avoid repairs and keep your car running like new more than any other thing you can do.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It is one of the few good fuel additives but not magic", "unixReviewTime": 1308268800, "reviewTime": "06 17, 2011"}

It did a nice job.  While the title of the product says wax, it makes a good quick detailer as well.

Regarding leaving streaks, I own a  black colored car and most quick detailers that I tried will leave some mimimal marks depending on the time of day when I use  them.  So don't worry about streaking.  I am using this product along side of Chemical Guys Pro Detailer ( a mix of carnauba and synthetic polymers).  They both work equally well leaving that \"just waxed\" slick feeling. In all honesty, the more I try quick detailers, the more I think they are all about the same in what they do.

As another reviewer mentioned, they are basically a foam pad on the inside with a microfiber cloth wrapped around the exterior.  This literally gives the best of both worlds!  The foam interior gives the pad shape which allows for an even application of wax.  The microfiber outside makes sure that you don't scratch your car as you apply it.  Also, I've noticed that for liquid waxes in particular, a sponge applicator seems to absorb a lot of the wax into the sponge itself, which is sort of a waste.  A rolled up microfiber towel avoids this absorption but it is very unwieldy and it's difficult to apply a smooth and even pressure on.  Again, these applicators solves those issues by combining the two.  Also, these pads are a nice size, probably about 5 inches in diameter, which allows you to cover a large area very quickly.  I find the pads that come with many wax kits to be far too small, which just means more work for you to cover your car.  Finally, washing these out is a snap and each applicator is durable enough for many waxes.

On an older vehicle, this can also clean out your carburetor, which normally can become troublesome with age. Like I said earlier, MMO is also a trade secret to those who race cars, many will swear by this product.MMO can also be used in RV's, which use diesel engines or the big rigs as well. It can also be used in, boats, ATV's, and landscaping equipment such as, mowers, trimmers, blowers. I also like MMO, cause it can be used in the oil crankcase of every engine. Over time, your engine can develop carbon deposits, having MMO in the crankcase will clean out these deposits. Then you can get rid of them at your next oil change.MY EXPERIENCE: My experience with MMO has been well, marvelous! I have been using it in my landscaping equipment for years now. And I find that machines, which I am treating with MMO, last longer then those that are not treated. For example, I can run MMO in the gas and oil of a Briggs V-Twin engine. I can then have another duplicate engine next to it without the MMO treatment.I can run both engines for 48 hours, and I can guarantee you, if I pull them both apart, the engine which was treated with MMO, will be the cleanest one. Another difference is with valve lifter ping, I am sure you have heard that from your engine before. Treat your engine with MMO, and I can guarantee you that the ping will go away. Why? Because, MMO cleans and lubricates your valve lifters.THE MANTIS TILLER: As some of you may know, I used to own a 2-cycle Mantis tiller. Well, after it was 3-years old, I was having some major troubles with it. What it needed was a carburetor rebuild kit, but since I was on the job, I had no time for that! I grabbed my bottle of MMO, which I bring with me, I applied two cap-fulls of this stuff to the tank. After running the engine at full throttle for 10-minutes, all of the sudden I gained engine power.

I said that I purchased 6 months ago and had kept for when I would need them.  She said that was too bad and there was nothing that could be done,,,,,that my improper storage was why they failed.I asked her if 3 year old originals that had been used and baked in the sun and elements were superior to Rain-X blades that had been stored properly for 6 months and unused.

Lisle places a drop of hot glue to the cardboard packaging to hold the tool in place while it is covered with shrink wrap. This would be ok if they used a small drop of glue instead of the giant blob the size of a quarter. After opening the package this giant glue blob ripped a large piece of the cardboard packaging with it that was super difficult to remove. I even shaved the sucker down with a razor knife before applying the solvent. The glue was some high quality stuff that was not easy to remove. I only wish I could find some glue this tough for my glue gun. It took me over one hour and quite a bit of Goo-Gone to rub it out enough to make the tool usable. New products should work as advertised straight out of the package without requiring an hour of rubbing and cleaning -- not to mention that Goo-Gone is not cheap! Simple aggravation is my only reason for knocking it down one star. My wife said that she has never seen me waste that much tool time on something that doesn't cost 10 minutes of billing time. I guess it is not in me to cut my losses and toss a brand new item in the trash when I should.The bristles are of a good quality that should last as long as reasonable force is applied when cleaning. Mechanics that jam these on either end without a little finesse are the cause of premature distorted bristles in my opinion. I don't think it is the tools fault. The bristles on the male end have a very slight distortion after the first use but nothing major that I don't experience on every other one I have ever used. As noted by other recent reviewers the male bristles are brass instead of stainless. I have both styles and think that both have advantages but am leaning towards the brass style since it looks better in a side to side comparison. I will buy again but do hope Lisle fixes the glue blob problem and I most likely will buy from a brick and mortar store so I can nake sure they're packaging robot didn't go nuts with the glue before I walk out of the store. I know Amazon has an excellent return service but personnally I hate to mail things back if I can possibly avoid it. It is time spent and that means lost money to me.Update: the glue mess that I experienced may have been an isolated incident as I have looked at a dozen or so hanging at local auto parts stores and they all had a very small drop of glue that didn't look anywhere near what I had to deal with. Note to Lisle if you reads these reviews -- find a way to package these tools without the need to glue them to the packaging since frustration free consumer packaging is both a current trend and you could save time and production costs to boot. Consider using a small piece of double sided tape instead.

Like most strong epoxy's, you have to combined the two for the product to work. They recommend you use a clean disposable container, I used a sour cream container which I washed first.The first thing you are going to want to do before you make a JB Weld mix, is to prep the surface before application. They recommend you use Acetone or paint thinner to clean the surface, as it will not leave a petroleum film, since I didn't have any of either, I used carburetor/choke cleaner.Since the surface's were already rough, I didn't have to rough them up. However, keep in mind, if you are planning to apply JB Weld to a smooth surface, you should also rough up the surface using a fine grit sand paper as a second preparation step. I began applying JB Weld, with my cheap $1.00 painters brush from the dollar store. I applied the thick compound evenly over the entire area which meshed with the rim.Then using a piece of wood on one side of the rim, and a C-clamp, I clamped the piece on the rim with pressure and left it there for over 24-hours. After 24-hours, the JB Weld was cured and I removed the C-clamp to reveal a very strong bond! I tried to move the piece back and fourth, but it wouldn't budge, its welded like it should be!The nice thing about JB Weld, is that it can be sanded, ground down, painted, after it has been cured. I noticed JB Weld had blooped out the edges after I installed the piece. So using a dremel with a deburring tool, I managed to grind it down flush with the rim.I also used this product to seal a gas leak in the tillers carburetor bowl. It actually did as advertised and sealed the leak, there is no gas leaking out of the carb now!CONCLUSION: While I would not have believed this product could actually weld metal together, I am now a believer.

{"reviewerID": "AI0BCEWRE04G0", "asin": "B0006O1ICE", "reviewerName": "Stoney", "helpful": [155, 163], "reviewText": "WHEN TO USE EPOXY CEMENTWhen you need a strong rigid workable (e.g. sandable and/or paintable surface) adhesive, particularly for use on metal or hard plastic, epoxy is usually the best choice.  Most epoxies dry with little running or shrinkage, and so are good for filling gaps.  The major drawback to epoxies is that they consist of two parts (resin and hardener) which must be mixed in small batches, and then applied with your own applicator (e.g., a toothpick or popsicle stick). Some are packaged in a dual-syringe--but that is not an adequate solution, because the components must still be manually mixed in order harden to maximum strength.WHEN TO USE JB-WELDJB-Weld is a very strong epoxy cement.  JB-Weld is the cement/glue of choice when joining metal parts or filling holes in metals.  Otherwise, ordinary epoxy cement or other types of cements/glues are usually better choices.  Some other reviewers have complained that the descriptive name \"weld\" is inappropriate---to some extent that's true.  JB Weld can do some jobs welding can't.  Conversely some simple welding jobs like joining two thin metal rods at right angles are difficult with JB Weld.HOW TO USE JB-WELDGeneral Principles: Although JB WELD makes an excellent filler---and can even be used to cast small parts, it is not remotely as strong as real metal used this way.  Whenever possible, use JB WELD as an adhesive---a very thin layer of JB WELD holding two pieces of metal together.  Always reinforce with metal pieces when possible.  For example, rather than building up a massive flange with JB Weld, you might be able to use scrap peice of metal to form most of the flange, held in place with JB Weld.  The greater the relative surface area of contact, the strong the bond will be.Surface Preparation:  As with any adhesive, the surface must be clean and rough.  Clean with a solvent (according to another reviewer, acetone is the best solvent for this purpose, but rubbing alcohol will work), roughen the surface, then clean with the solvent again.  Use a clean cloth for each application of solvent.  I generally use a small grinding wheel in a Dremel tool to roughen the surfaces.  You can also scratch the surface with a knife, or use coarse sandpaper, or both depending on the material.The solvent cleaning is for removing the LAST TRACES of oil from CLEAN surfaces.  If the parts are oily, even multiple cleanings with solvent may not be enough---you may redeposit oil from your cleaning cloth or as the solvent evaporates on the surface.  So, if you can detect any oil on any portion of the part, or if you have any doubt, clean it with a degreaser first.  If you do not have a commercial degreaser handy, a paste of laundry detergent and a stiff brush may do the trick.  Only when you are certain that there are no traces of oil is it time for the solvent cleaning(s).Joining Broken Parts: If you are joining broken parts, with a clean but irregular matching surfaces, limit the roughening to scratching with a wire brush or etching with an acid (but be sure to wash off all traces of the acid). Apply a THIN uniform layer of JB WELD, lightly clamp together hard enough to squeeze out any excess. Sometimes a thick rubber band is perfect. Often you can arrange pieces so that the weight of the top piece will hold the joint together until the JB Weld cures. Sometimes you can place a weight (such as a brick) on top to apply gentle pressure.  Do not remove the clamp or pressure until the JB Weld has cured completely.  After an hour or two, after the glue has set but is still soft, you can cut off any excess with a knife or razor---but if you don't need to cut the excess off, don't.  Often you can build-up the surfaces around a break for added strength.  Sometimes blue painters tape can be used to help hold pieces together while the glue sets, and/or to make a temporary stand to hold the pieces in the best orientation.ScotchBlue Painter's Tape for Multi-Surfaces 2090-.75A, 3/4 Inches by 60 Yards, 1 RollJoining Dissimilar Parts:  Minimize any gaps if possible, e.g., by sanding if possible so that the contact as perfect as possible.  If you will be filling substantial gaps, sometimes it is helpful to cover openings with blue painters tape to prevent the JB Weld from flowing away and leaving gaps.Joining Long Thin Parts (rods or sheets): Try to overlap if possible, or reinforce them with a similar overlapping peice of metal glued in place with JB Weld.  To join a 1/8\" steel rod, to another 1/8\" steel rod, forming a \"T\" (a common and easy welding job, almost impossible with just JB-Weld), cut two 1\"-long \"L's\" from a heavy-paper clip, (or make L's from similar wire), and embed those with JB-Weld on opposite sides of the joint.  You can further strenthen the joint by wrapping fine steel wire around the rods holding the \"L\"s in place---before  covering it all with JB-Weld.  Be sure to thoroughly clean the rods and wires first (see below).  For small parts, or when wire wouldn't work well, unwaxed dental floss is remarkably strong, and can do an excellent job of reinforcing joints (when embeded in JB Weld). Ideally, apply the JB Weld, then wind the floss tightly into the soft JB Weld.Filling Holes:  Don't forget to prepare the surfaces as described above---even if you can only roughen the surfaces with an ice pick or awl.  JB Weld shrinks very little as it cures so fill the hole completely.  If it is possible to sand the surface when the JB Weld has hardened, then overfill the hole slightly.  Since JB Weld flows a little until it sets, the surface should be horizontal.  If not horizontal, you can apply the JB Weld and then cover the hole with blue painters tape until the JB Weld sets.  Depending on the job, it is often a better strategy to fill the gap as much as possible with a piece (or pieces) of metal embedded in JB Weld that a single mass of pure JB Weld.Reinforcing a leaking pipe:  Work JB Weld into a piece of fiberglass cloth or with a spatula, apply, and then add more JB Weld to any thin spots and to feather out the edges. You may have to apply several layers of the JB Weld-saturated fiberglass cloth. Sometimes wire cloth (window screening) can be used.Holes in car body panels etc:  If you can cover at least one side of the hole with a piece of sheet metal (held in place by JB Weld) that is a good strategy---the combination of pop-rivets and JB Weld often works especially well, even if you ultimately sand the heads of the pop rivets away.TEKTON 6555 Rivet Gun with 40-pc. RivetsMixing:  Follow the instructions.  A paper plate can be a good mixing surface; popsicle sticks are the best mixing tools.  Beware that you must use the same amount of resin and hardener, and they MUST be VERY thoroughly mixed.  Mix until you are certain that it is completely and thoroughly mixed, and then continue mixing for twice that time.  Seriously!!!Curing:  Follow the instructions, but wait longer than recommended: the longer you wait the stronger the bond.  A a day or two at 70 or 80 degrees is a reasonable MINIMUM.  Note that epoxies do not \"dry\"--there are no solvents to evaporate, instead a chemical reaction hardens the cement (a plastic resin).  Chemical reactions are proportional to temperature (the rule of thumb is that for each 10 degrees, the reaction speed doubles).  Using the rule of thumb, if it takes 1 day to cure at 80 degrees, then it takes 16 days to cure at 40 degrees, and that's only to minimally cured.  Okay, I know that waiting this long is not practical in many circumstances---you can probably get away with curing for 4 hours at 90 degrees (but don't go much higher than 90 degrees), and \"take it easy\" for a couple of days.WHEN TO USE OTHER EPOXIESFor materials other than metal, particularly for rigid plastics, other epoxies are usually better than JB Weld.  Some epoxies are clear, or white, or specialized for particular purposes.  For exampleCLEARBOND H-3S Clear Strong Epoxy Adhesive Syringe - .85ozWHEN TO USE QUICK-EPOXIESOrdinary (slow) epoxies (whether JB Weld or other epoxies) dry harder than quick epoxies and are generally the best choice.  Maximum strength is the whole point of epoxies--if you don't need maximum strength---you probably do not need epoxy.  Use quick epoxies when 1) the hardening speed is essential, 2) when the item cannot be supported in the required orientation while the epoxy sets (at least several hours), or 3) when you have to absolutely minimize flowage.  Super-glue is often a good alternative in such situations.WHEN TO USE OTHER CEMENTS OR GLUESWhile epoxies are ideal for a few specific uses (primarily when you need a rigid cement for metal or rigid plastic)--there are many situations when other types of glue are better choices.  Epoxies are generally NOT recommended for flexible surfaces, such as leather, wood, or flexible plastic, and generally do not adhere well to glass, etc.  While epoxies may work with porous surfaces (paper, wood, ceramics, etc.), other adhesives are usually better.White Glue: For most light-duty indoor household applications which do not have to be waterproof, ordinary household white glue is safe, cleanup is very easy, and in most cases repairs are redo-able if you make a mistake.  White glue shrinks a great deal as it dries, and so is not good for filling holes or large gaps.  For example:Elmer's All Multipurpose White Glue, 7 5/8 oz. (E379)Glue Stick: Think of glue sticks as thick white household glue in stick form.  Glue sticks are great with paper, but have few other applications.Avery Glue Stic, 0.26 oz, Pack of 6, (98095)Wood Glue: Carpenters's wood glue is essentially water-proof (when dry) white household glue.  It penetrates and strengthens the wood better than any other type of glue. It is safe, and cleanup is easy. If the joint breaks again (because the wood is weak), it can be re-glued. For example:Elmer's E701 Carpenter's Wood Glue 8-OunceGoop:  Goop will bond virtually any material, including leather, plastics, glass, and metal.  The bond is clear, VERY strong, waterproof, and hard but flexible.  Since Goop is clear, if a little extra oozes out, it is barely noticeable. I've used Goop to repair ceramic plant pots, water hoses, and shoes; to seal holes in air-mattresses, to close small holes in window screens, as plumbers paste in assembling plumbing parts, to  I also use it to seal rust spots on my dishwasher rack--the Goop it also makes a \"cushioned\" surface that will prevent scratches to dishes.  Goop is particular good for repairing damaged electrical cords.Amazing Goop All-Purpose Household Goop, 3.7-Ounce Tube #130012Silicon Glue: Silicon glue is best for glass, and when you want a truly flexible connection (for example, to absorb vibrations). It is a good alternative for Goop for general household use on glass, plastic, and metal when you do not need the maximum possible strength. It is safer than Goop, and cleanup is easier. Like Goop, silicon glue takes days to reach reasonable strength, weeks to reach maximum strength. For example:GE Silicone II Household Glue, 2.8 ozFabric Glue:Beacon Fabri-Tac Permanent Adhesive, 4-Ounceworks amazingly well on fabrics, saturating the surfaces enough to provide a very strong bond, but without soaking through.  Depending on the application, fabric glue can be better than sewing.  It remains very flexible, e.g., it would probably be great on leather or heavy vinyl (e.g., women's handbags, shoes, luggage, etc.)Super-Glue (Krazy Glue): Super-glue is very strong, rigid, and fast. In many ways it is similar to 2-minute epoxy---except that no mixing is required. Although very hard, super-glue is brittle, and so, is not recommended for flexible objects. Super-glue is hazardous in that it can easily glue fingers (etc.) together.  Previously, I used super-glue frequently on objects (e.g., jewelry) when a clear bond was required---however, Goop is better for such applications, safer, and more conveneient. Opened super-glue keeps poorly, even in tighly sealed glass containers---so I recommended packages of multiple very small tubes.BAZIC Super Glue, 3 grams 0.10 ounces, 6 Per PackLiquid Nails/Construction Adhesive:  When you need to permanently join a large amount of surface, of almost any kind, Construction Adhesive is usually ideal. If you need to join 2 2x4s to make a 4x4 Construction Adhesive is better than nails.  Most construction adhesives are slightly flexible, and so can even be used on leather (i.e., to repair a loose shoe sole), etc.  Construction adhesive may leave a stain on porous surfaces, and may stain-through thin surfaces.  For small projects, Goop is usually a better choice.Caulking Compound:  You can think of caulking compound as white household glue with alot of inert filler--to use when you need to fill holes.  As an adhesive, it is the weakest on this list, but is strong enough for many purposes when spread over a large surface, such as the back of a ceramic tile.  A few years ago, I made a brick column to support a mailbox.  Traditionally, I should have used mortar--which would have been very time consuming.  I could have used construction adhesive (albeit any excess that squeezed out would have been ugly)--but caulking compound was quick, cheap, looks good, and was more than adequate for the job.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Does the Job", "unixReviewTime": 1332892800, "reviewTime": "03 28, 2012"}

The minimum cross section is the same as your stock tube so its not capable of flowing any more air than stock.  It still has the sharp 90 degree turn to the throttle body that the OEM system has.  There may be some minor reduction of turbulance, but at most engine speeds, especially where the engine spends most of its time, it won't matter.  I've never seen an independent  dyno test published with a before and after with just this mod.  Clearly the postings on Airaid's site are BS.

In just a few minutes the steering wheel, instrument panel, center console, door panel, back speaker deck, glove box and other plastic, chrome and vinyl interior component turn from dusty to sparkling clean. Using these wipes beats spraying on a cleaner and then trying to wipe it off with a cloth... I go through four or five wipes each time, so the canister should supply enough for five or six cleanings.The reason for four stars -- the quality control of the wipes' canister is just not good, as we have had brand new packages opened dry, others drying out within a short period of time, and then others staying nice and damp all the way until the last wipe was used. Since we like the wipes but no longer trust the canister, we dump the contents (wipes and fluid) into a large zip-loc bag for safekeeping. That works well, but we really should not have to do this... so, four stars instead of five.Other Armor All products that we really like are the tire foam (Armor All Tire Foam Protectant 20 oz (1 lb 4 oz) 567 g) which produces a rich looking satin finish, the leather wipes (ArmorAll Leather Wipes Canister, 20 Wipes - Cleans, Conditions and Protects) which are great on my GT's leather seats, and the protectant (Armor All 10228 Original Protectant - 28 oz.) is excellent on the dash and all interior and exterior rubber.Highly recommend this product if you have a similar need... but think about keeping them in a zip-loc bag or something with a good seal.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Armor All Cleaning Wipes - Very good cleaning wipe - cannister is hit or miss though", "unixReviewTime": 1359331200, "reviewTime": "01 28, 2013"}

The bottom line however, is that these batteries are so well made that they will probably outlast a standard battery 5 times over, so what's the logical point to extend the warranty to two years to begin with.

Why they don't come stock on this trailer is beyond me, but it would seem many smaller campers only have them in the rear.  Anyway, first impressions: quality manufacturing (yes, made in China ironically) and solid.  When I set these next to my factory jacks that came with my Ameri-Lite 16BHC, it was immediately evident that the Camco versions were much more solid.  Overall, they are just &#34;thicker&#34; - more steel was used when making them.I was worried for a moment because it felt like both were locked into their closed positions, so before I went through the trouble of bolting them on (which required drilling through my travel trailer's steel frame), I made sure they opened by clamping them to a solid surface in my home and opening them.  They were tight, but eventually I got them to open without issue.Installation wasn't complicated, but slightly laborious.  Drilling through solid steel is never a fun time when you're on your back in the driveway!  :)  The instructions call for them to be extended, then your frame marked with a punch via a hammer, then remove jacks, then pilot drill a small hole, a following it up with the bolt-size 11/32&#34; bit.All I did was fully extend them where I wanted them, drilled the small pilot hole while they were holding the bottom of my frame up, then removed them, then drilled the larger 11/32&#34; hole - MUCH EASIER.  No need to use a punch.These come pretty dry from the factory, so plan on lubricating them with some lithium grease or similar to help them collapse/extend and protect them from rusting.  My 2013 Ameri-Lite 16BHC came with scissor jacks that were already showing corrosion just by sitting on the sales lot (purchased in May 2013).

For the small price, they take the dull moose horns in most American cars and make them into the sexy European higher tone ones we hear in every movie shot in Europe where the bad guy is rushing through traffic. Great way to make your import sound authentic, and great fun for other brands.This kit comes with the 500 & 600 Mhz horns. Almost all cars in America have a 400 and 500 set.

So, it you can pick up just the 600 Mhz horn by itself, for a good price, that's all you need. The horns have two spade connectors, which may or may not fit your auto setup. If you are at all handy, installing these is no big deal, BUT, for many cars, you WILL have to cut off the connectors in your car, and splice in new ones, so if you don't even know what \"splice\" means, or you don't want to cut a wire on your car, better to leave this one.

If you do have only one horn its a simple matter to re-wire for two horns.  The package includes simple easy to follow wiring diagrams and a pair of ground wires (one for each horn).  In my case I had one power wire to one horn, so I joined two wires together at the male end (to plug into the power lead) and two separate female ends to plug into the horns.

Maybe the 100 watt model would be better than these 130's if your eyes are sensitive to bright lights.  Exactly what my 2004 Dodge Ram needed because the factory headlights stink.  My brights were no brighter than my low beam, and my old 1985 Nissan had brighter brights, but these KC 130 watt driving lights solved that problem perfectly.  For not being the full, long range lights KC offers, they sure shine pretty far, plus spread the light out to the sides and up into the trees, a good long range / flood combination.  I mounted them to my push/brush guard.  Took about 3 hours to install because I like to route, hide, and secure the wires very well.  I connected the white switch / relay hot wire to my high beam (brights)wire on the drivers side, so they go on and off with my high / low switch, plus I have the master switch mounted (without the switch frame) near the dash to keep the KC lights off completely if I want.  Just make sure you dim your lights (turn off the KC's) before you see anyone ahead of you or you'll blind them and can get a ticket if on a public road.  First night I tried them a big 8 point ran across the road in front of me, then stopped and pretty much \"tip toed\" off the road as if he was totally blind and afraid to move.  So beware of animals freezing in front of you with these things.  I turned them off and honked so he could run away.  And no, I don't hunt that way.The wiring diagram on the outside of the box did not show the white power / relay wire, as if it was pre-wired into the main power wire, but luckily there was the white power / relay wire available to tap into my high beam wire.  The wiring diagram on the directions in the box was correct.  Some vehicles newer than 1999 may not allow tapping into the high beam wire because of the vehicle's computer that senses voltage changes, but it worked on mine.  Only thing I had to supply was a sheet metal screw to secure the relay.  I cut off about 5 feet of extra wire that went to the switch.

I purchased my '10 RX8 in May 2010 with 16 miles on the clock and have been babying her ever since. After a few goes at conventional oil to break in the engine, I switched over to the RP after some great suggestions by the rx8 community. In doing so I took care to be very meticulous about my oil changes, performing them every 3000 miles, and saving samples to send to Blackstone labs just to make sure that the oil was doing a good job and that my engine was healthy. I ran the RP 5w30 in the winter, and then ran their 10w40 in the summer and had absolutely no problems. Once I changed out my first interval of the 10w40, I sent the samples over to BSL (~$40 total to sample both) to check the results. Although the numbers were above average, the Viscosity numbers were a tad low .... not alarmingly low, but I expected them to be stable considering that this is a premium oil. The guys over at BSL assured me that this was completely normal, and because my car only has 10k miles on it now, it could just be residuals from breakin/conventional oil use/some 5w30 that stayed in the sump when i put the 10w40. In any case, I sent my reports over to the folks at RP just to have them take a look-see. Within a few hours I got back a reply from the RP team pretty much confirming what the guys over at BSL said. Along with that, they stated that they wanted to continue monitoring my use just to be 100% sure that their assumptions are correct. They sent me free sample kits and told me to send them some samples when I do an oil change again.There aren't that many companies out there that A. produce a fantastic product, B. advertise without bogus claims, and most importantly C. stand by their product 100%. If anything, this company got my respect and loyalty due to their immediate response and their handling of my concerns. Now again, let me stress, my oil analysis numbers were fantastic and were exactly what was expected of a newer car...but just because I had concerns the folks at RP asked me to send them over more samples so they can run an analysis free of charge.I hope that helps most of you that are still on the fence about trying this product even though it has a fantastic quality reputation.

I'll review the trans fluid there (Royal Purple Synchromax) since that made a huge difference.  My car runs much quieter and smoother after the fluid changes.  I can not really tell if this oil made a difference in the differential since I did several changes at once but it definitely didn't make things worse.  The old differential oil came out completely clear and was as much fluid as expected so I'm pretty sure things have been running as expected back there.After I had already ordered this I found that some BMW owners run Mobil 1 gear oil in the differential since it is said to run cooler there than RP or Redline oil.  So I could have saved several dollars per quart and maybe gotten better performance, but I don't drive the car hard so this will do just fine. 5 stars since my car is running so much better that I'll give some credit to this oil.Update 06/2012 - Several tanks of gas later and my MPG is higher.  Since I replaced the trans fluid and this at the same time, not sure which or if both made the difference.  Really improved the highway MPG, and it just did 32.09 MPG, doing the relatively flat round trip Los Angeles to Palm Springs plus some other mainly highway driving.
