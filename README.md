TO DO:
1. abstract functions in anomaly.py, incentivized.py, and similarity.py by making an abstract parent class called detection_algorithms that will have shared functions.
2. abstract views.plot() into one function called three times for similarity, anomaly, and incentivized scoring
3. Lookup normalization (about what consitutes new relations) and update/migrate models and file_to_database to include the bool 'incentivized' (similar to duplicate). Also update relation documentation.
4. fix static file location
